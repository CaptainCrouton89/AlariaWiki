### Traits

#### Of the Swamp
*Passive ability*

The swamp is impossible to farm, so all food has to be gathered and scavengedâ€”an immensely difficult task in a swamp, but one you've grown accustomed to. So long as there is food in your environment, you know where you can find it. 

You have developed a natural immunity to most of the toxins that can be found in swamps, and do not take damage from poisons, gasses, fumes, or venom.
