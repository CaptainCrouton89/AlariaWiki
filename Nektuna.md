An incredibly powerful state, as they control the [Tarkhetan Strait](Tarkhetan Strait)â€”a very thin passage of water connecting the [Shattered Sea](Shattered Sea) to the [Gray Sea](Gray Sea). They tax all trade that passes throug the port. Many aren't happy about this, but [Tarkhetan](Tarkhetan) is a massive fortress with powerful armaments and a large navy. The city is located on a leyline of fire, and powerful firemages grow up in the city, capable of easily burning ships down from afar.

Nektuna is hardly safe, however. They are surrounded on all sides by those interested in taking their wealth and controlling the strait themselves. 

Based loosely on king's landing from GoT. Controlled by many lords from different regions.

Nektuna is farily diverse place, home to primarily [humans](Humans), but with a massive population of [Craven](Craven), and smaller populations of dwarblin, trollkin, and even ayblek. A fair number of [weblin](Weblin) also travel throughout, selling their wares.

Also controls the island of [Pyris](Pyris). Pyris is home to an old [race](Races) of [dwarves](Dwarves), who have interbred with humans long enough to be very rough mix of the two. Mostly farmers who want to live simple lives. 

Nektuna also contains the city [Besnoumeru](Besnoumeru), which lies directly on the leyline of time. Besnoumeru is almost as famously wealthy as Tarkhetan for the phenomenol ability of its merchants to predict the changes in supply and demand before they happen.

In possession of [Astrelle](Astrelle).
