# Timeline

Time, to the most modern scholar’s best understanding, has consisted of three eons of full world cycles. Each cycle is marked by ending with a reality warping event. The current cycle is still relatively “young” in terms of eon cycles.

## The Early Times

The first eon. Little is known about this time period.

### The Cyclone of Possibilities: 4–1.3 billion years ago

During this time, nearly nothing is known. It is generally believed that a primordial soup of the cosmos was swirling around, with the period eventually cumulating with the rise of Azus. Azus and Melera were the first gods, each with differing mindsets. 

- Each created their own system of laws and behaviours of the world. For azus, everything was to be described, things had rules, and there was perfect balance: for creation, there would come destruction
- Melera, she viewed the world as an instrument, to be played. Creating beauty from nothing—there is no cost to creating somethign wonderful with music. Nobody knows about her, or knows this story.
- Azus hated the freeform nature of Melera, locked her in a prison of specificity.
- He creates the world alone. Begins organizing things into categories and boxes. Uses his magic, "Deoric" magic to do so. 
- Although Melera remains locked away still to this day, she creates her music from her prison, and it resonates across the universe. 
	- Things attributed to Melera
    	- Music
        - Gaea
        - Gaeic Melodies
        - Druids (part melody, part deoric origins—true mix)
        - The alarian planar stack bursting and Ezz spilling in was her. Before that, there was much more strict separation of the planes.
- Azus is off toying with othr plains—hasn't visited Alaria since the The Wash—when his project was "ruined" (tainted by Melera's music). Melera has taken special interest in Alaria however, for she sees hope of someone there one day rising up and setting her free.

### The Contraction: 1,300–235 million years ago

Azus began manipulating the cosmos, pulling the cosmic soup closer and closer together. It is believed he used an ancient ancestor of the [Deoric](Deoric) language to do so. Over the course of over a billion years, Azus tightened and tightened the universe, bringing everything closer and closer together.

#### The Death of Azus: 235 million years ago

As the universe contracted, enormous voids began opening up, sucking up everything around them. Some countless number of voids opened up around the cosmos, eating up everything, faster and faster. 

As these voids filled with more and more of the cosmos, some exploded, while others instead began slowly releasing intense radiant light. These explosions formed rifts in the cosmos, forming the planar stacks of the cosmos, while the voids that began editing light were scattered throughout the universe and now can be found in some of the planar stacks, such as the Alarian sun. This marked the end of the first eon.

### The Age of Titans 235–100 million years ago

#### [Alaria](Alaria) is Born: 235 million years ago

[Alaria](Alaria) was one of the last planar stacks to form. It opened up without any psyic energy, and with only three [planes](Planes)—the material realm, the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane), and [Malstaris](Malstaris).

#### Lyzarian Era: 235–180 million years ago

With the Lyzarus the first titan was born. Titans were enormous, powerful beings who were responsible for creating most life on [Alaria](Alaria), probably also using [Deoric](Deoric). They populated all three [planes](Planes), though their most epic civilizations were built up in the depths of the Astral Sea and deep in the caves of [Malstaris](Malstaris).

#### The Wash: 120 million years ago

The reign of titans ended with the Wash—a world flood that began when a leak in the Alarian [Planar Stack](Planar Stack) caused [Ezz](Ezz) to fill up the [planar stack](Planar Stack). As [Alaria](Alaria) filled with Ezz, titans died in droves, suffocating and wracked with madness. Those who could fled the plane, abandoning their cities, and flew to the cosmos. Where they are, if they are even still alive, remains a mystery. 

This marked the end of the second eon. The dead titan bodies that remain on [Alaria](Alaria) are great sources of magical power, even today, though their scarcity is a source of enormous conflict wherever they are found. 

## The Gaeaic Eon: 120,000,000–7,210 years ago

Back in [Alaria](Alaria), the influx of Ezz drove the [spirit](Life and Death) plane away from the [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death) [planes](Planes), creating the additional plane we have today, [Celesté](Celesté). Many creatures died with the titans, but many others survived, acclimating to the new mixed atmosphere. This new planar atmosphere is now known as the substrate in which psyic energy can flow. This gave new life, thought, and diversity to life on [Alaria](Alaria), and also marked the beginning of the third eon.

### Gaea is Born: 120 million years ago

The new world also gave rise to Gaea, the Earth Mother. Gaea was responsible for bringing emotion to [Alaria](Alaria). Her [magic](Magic) came straight from the psyic energy of [Alaria](Alaria), and she channeled it with the language she named as [Kethic](Kethic Elementalism). Her home was everywhere, but she was strongest in the material realm. Gaea also had three sons: [Nagatayora](Nagatayora), the First Dragon; [Ulvma](Ulvma), the First Wolf; and [Shara Bolasi](Shara Bolasi), the First Lion. Together, these were her protectors.

Gaea also created all manners of life. The mammoths of the northern [plains](Plains), the [dinosaurs](Dinosaurs) of the easter [jungles](Jungles), the scorpions in the deserts, the giant rocs that soared across the skies, and everything else in between. However, intelligent life was absent except for the [druids](Druids).

### The Druids: 120 million years ago

Along with Gaea came the [druids](Druids)—an ancient [race](Races) of beings so in touch with nature that they were believed to be incarnations of the wilderness and life itself. The [druids](Druids) do not belong to Gaea, like nearly every other creature born in this period, but work along side her. Often, their interests align, but not always.

The [druids](Druids) build small villages wherever there was life on [Alaria](Alaria). They took care of the land, and worked powerful [magic](Magic) to control it. Little is known about the type of [magic](Magic) they possess, but it is not [Kethic](Kethic Elementalism) nor [Deoric](Deoric). 

### The Reign of Dragons: 100–2.5 million years ago

Of her three children, [Nagatayora](Nagatayora) was the eldest and proudest, and the species he spawned would prove to become the most powerful creatures since the Age of Titans. During this time, [dragons](Dragons) covered all six [planes](Planes) of [Alaria](Alaria), securely at the top of the social and natural food chain.

[Ulvma](Ulvma) and Shara also became the first of their species, and populated the [forests](Forests) and [plains](Plains) of [Alaria](Alaria). As sibling species, the three groups would never prey on each eachother—something that remains true, even among the Naga, Sharabha, and Ulvsjael today.

#### The Walk of Elves: 10 million years ago

Although the [druids](Druids) never die of natural causes, they have slowly been killed off over time, such that only a few reside in [Alaria](Alaria) today. However, their legacy remains, as the [elves](Elves) were created by the druids, from the branches of trees, the stones and mud from the rivers that ran through [Alaria](Alaria), and the life from the druids. The [elves](Elves) were made in the druid's images, and share their pointed ears, slender forms, and graceful movement, and have similar appreciations for nature and beauty as the druids.

The [elves](Elves) were good at everything they did, and quickly grew in population as they covered Alaria. They worked in harmony with the [dragons](Dragons), and together, ruled the land.

### The Birth of Man: 2,500,000–45,000 years ago

Gaea, jealous of the success and intelligence of the [elves](Elves) and the druids, soon set about working on her own creation. Although not as thoughtfully constructed as the [elves](Elves), the determination that fueled her craft flowed into her creation, and from her work spawned the beastmen and [humans](Humans). 

#### The Golden Age of Man: 200,000–75,000 years ago

Of the [races](Races) of Gaea, [humans](Humans) were by far the most versatile and ambitious, and it was not long before [humans](Humans) had covered Alaria. This began the Golden Age of Man—125,000 years of flourishing civilization. Technology reached incredible levels that have never been reached since. Flying machines soared across the skies and beyond the [planes](Planes), civilizations stretched from deep within the seas to high in the clouds, and magical knowledge was common and plentiful.

This time also gave rise to the [daemons](Daemons) of [Celesté](Celesté). As Gaea’s children explored the world, the nature of the bond between Celesté, the material realm, and the psyic energy enveloping them both became known. People began moving across the boundary in droves, and the population dramatically shifted away from the material realm to Celesté.

#### The God War: 75,000 years ago

As people shifted over, believers and prayers started to quickly fade, and people across Celesté begat disappearing. With the risks of returning to the material realm being to great, many remained, and fought viciously amongst themselves for followers on the material realm.

The combination of a competition for survival among the [daemons](Daemons) and a gross expenditure of power on their followers resulted in total war. Most people died, many others returned from Celesté and hid in isolation, and others fought on. The world war continued for years until a follower of Dyos used all of the power of his god to force an eruption of the Kajiit volcano. Immediately killing millions more, this began a volcanic winter that would set the world into a multi-millennia ice age.

#### The Long Winter: 75,000–45,000 years ago

As everything died, and ice age set in, the small pockets of surviving civilization went into hiding in the mountains, surviving off of lichens and hunting the wild animals that roamed the surface. No [daemons](Daemons) survived, as residents of the material realm lost all faith in their gods. Hundreds of [dragons](Dragons) died as well, while many of those who survived terrorized the skies, hunting anything that could be found. Technology regressed to a primitive [state](States) once more.

### The Age of Craggus: 45,000–30,000 years ago

The Age of Craggus began when Craggus, a young man, survived a journey to [Celesté](Celesté) with an avid group of devotees who remained alive in their tribe back on the material realm. The tribe began spreading the word of Craggus, who grew in power and slowly began to lift civilization out of despair. He was the first Daemon, god of all men.

#### The Rise of the King: 45,000 years ago

Over the next thousand years, Craggus’ name became more and more known, and with magnificent effort, he pushed back the ice age, ending millions of years of desolation. He was seen as a [hero](Heroes), and became the sole god of the material realm. 

#### Craggus’ Reign: 45,000–30,000 years ago

The next fifteen thousand years were marked by Craggus’ kingship among the [daemons](Daemons) of [Celesté](Celesté). Although society returned to its [state](States) of frequent war and conflict, and others joined Craggus in [Celesté](Celesté), Craggus remained king of all, and Alaria remained relatively stable. Technology climbed back to an industrial level, as people relearned how to harness the power of aetherium. Fortunate period during which the killing moon remained dormant for the duration.

### The Lost Ages: 30,000–10,209 years ago

Less is known about the Lost Ages, as the time was marked by years of hardship and despair. Craggus' reign came to an end with the start of the laughing plague, which destroyed much of the progress made up to this point. 

#### The Laughing Plague: 30,000–28,800 BSD

Craggus’ reign was brought to an end with the arrival of the laughing plague. The laughing plague was a brutal disease from the plane of Glyssen. How it got to [Alaria](Alaria) remains unknown, but it slowly drove all those exposed to it into a fevering, maniacal madness that incited them to horrible acts of violence, all while unconrollably laughing. It spread through prolonged exposure to the sound of the laughter, and brought nearly all of [Alaria](Alaria) to bloodthirsty insanity. A fight for the survival of life on [Alaria](Alaria) began, with creatures forced to turn on their own kin who had been infected. For 1,200 years, the Alarian population dwindled as people went into isolation and trade and progress stopped.

The disease ran its course, and left the civilizations of [Alaria](Alaria) in shambles. Entire cities lay barren—their citizens all dead, at each others’ hands. Only those deep underground or completely isolated survived unaffected. Most written history was lost at this time, and technology once again regressed to a primitive [state](States). 

##### Dwarves

A few among the population held a natural resistance to this corrupting plague. Although they were immune to it's violence inciting effects, the disease stunted growth and fundamentally and permanently changed those who survived it. These men were known as dwarves. Entire communities of those immune formed—many of which were underground.

It is rumored that the laughing plague still circulates deep underground [Alaria](Alaria), among the [Kackles](Kackles)—held at bay by the Uline dwarves.

#### Rise of the False God: 28,700–28,000 BSD

#### Blight of Arcanus: 12,000 BSD

[Magic](Magic) was cursed, using it killed you. Brought down the entire empire.

#### The Dark Night: 12,000–11,500 BSD

#### The Oblivion Years: 11,500–10,400 BSD

Lost all information. Starting over.

#### The Hel Dynasties: 11,400–10,900 BSD

Series of tryannical dynasties, complete overlords over world

Ends with the [Killing Moon](Killing Moon).

#### The Blood War: 10,900 BSD

Battle between dynasties, no winners

### Hykravones: 10,210–10,209 BSD

Before the titans fled and died, Hykravones, the Gray Prince went into inter dimensional space, only returning millions of years later. The world as he knew it had been destroyed, and he flew into a rage, and began dismantling [Alaria](Alaria).

Gaea’s children, with the help of several other peoples including the [Vystrilik](Vystrilik) fought the Gray Prince. The daemons across Celesté helped where they could, though efforts were disjointed. Daemons did not want to give up everything they had, at risk of losing followers and influence. By the time they realized they had to, it was too late.

The Gray Prince ultimately destroyed nearly all civilization. Nearly ever daemon died as their base of followers was wiped out. The World was set back thousands of years technologically. After ravaging the world, the Gray Prince went dormant, never to be seen again. Legend is that he still lives on Alaria, asleep deep within the ground, one day to reawaken and finish his work.

#### Rebirth of Gaea's Children

From the blood and soil of gaea's fallen children rose the Sharabha, Ulvsjael, and Naga. 

#### The Greatest Sacrifice

In the final months of Hykavones' destruction, nearly every daemon across Celesté saw that they were about to get completely wiped out. While some faught, others snuck back to the material plane—taking on new forms and going into hiding. These daemons would ultimately go on to found new races—descending from themselves. 

## The Modern Era: 10,209 BSD–Now

The Modern Era makes up the third and current eon.

### The Great Expansion: 9,950–0 BSD
