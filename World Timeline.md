# Timeline of Alaria

## The Primordial Era: The Birth of Everything

In the unfathomable vastness of pre-existence, two formless entities emerged: Melera and Azus. Often referred to as "she" and "he" respectively, these primordial beings embodied infinite power but lacked purpose. Their interactions gave birth to the universe itself, a grand attempt at communication and self-expression.

### The Cyclone of Possibilities (4 - 1.3 billion years ago)

In the swirling cosmic soup of early existence, Azus and Melera manifested as the first gods, each with distinct philosophies that would shape the fabric of reality:

- **Azus**: The embodiment of order and balance, Azus envisioned a universe governed by strict rules. His ideology dictated that for every act of creation, there must be an equal act of destruction. Azus valued logic, linearity, and the preservation of cosmic equilibrium.

- **Melera**: In stark contrast, Melera perceived the universe as a grand instrument capable of producing beauty from chaos. Her approach emphasized dynamic expression and fluidity, rejecting the constraints of rigid order. Melera's nature remains shrouded in mystery, her narrative largely lost to time.

Together, these primordial entities fashioned Ezz, an energy that embodies both their beliefs. However, Azus soon recognized that his ideals of law and order were irretrievably compromised by the unpredictability inherent within Ezz. In response, he created Planar Stacks, protective bubbles shielding realities from the chaos of Ezz.

Most planar stacks remained void of Melera's influence, with Alaria standing as a notable exception due to a rift causing massive amounts of Ezz to spill through from the beyond.

### The Contraction (1.3 billion - 235 million years ago)

For over a billion years, Azus meticulously manipulated the cosmos, building planar stacks throughout existence. This period, known as the Contraction, saw Azus tightening and sorting the universe, bringing everything closer together and into neater arrangements. The universe as we know it began to take shape during this time, with the fundamental laws of physics and magic slowly solidifying.

## The Age of Titans (235 - 100 million years ago)

### The Birth of Alaria (235 million years ago)

Alaria, one of the last planar stacks to form, came into existence without any psyic energy. Initially, it consisted of only three primary planes: the Material Realm, the Astral Plane, and Malstaris. This unique configuration would later play a crucial role in shaping the world's magical landscape.

### The Lyzaria Era (235 - 180 million years ago)

The first titans to emerge were the god-titans: Nydus, Aurus, and Celesté. These siblings possessed power far beyond that of any other beings. From their union came Lyzaria, the first true titan and the namesake of this era.

Titans were colossal, powerful beings responsible for creating most life on Alaria. They likely used Deoric magic in their creations, though the exact methods remain a mystery. Titans populated all three planes, building their most epic civilizations in the depths of the Astral Sea and deep within the caves of Malstaris.

#### The Sacrifice of Celesté

Celesté, the youngest of the god-titan siblings, was assigned dominion over the Material Plane. Unlike her brothers, she had been touched by Melera's song, granting her a unique perspective on creation. Witnessing the frequent battles between Nydus and Aurus, which often resulted in the destruction of other titans' work, Celesté made a fateful decision.

In an act of supreme sacrifice, Celesté transformed herself into a celestial body that would become her namesake. This new astral formation became a source of power for the titans of the Material Plane, forever changing the magical landscape of Alaria.

### The Ezz Rift (120 million years ago)

The reign of titans came to a catastrophic end with the Ezz Rift—a world-altering event that began when a leak in the Alarian Planar Stack caused Ezz to flood the world. As Alaria filled with Ezz, Melera's music permeated every corner of existence.

The titans, beings of pure logic and order, had never experienced emotions before. The sudden onslaught of feelings drove them to madness. Countless titans, naturally ageless, chose to end their own lives to escape the unfamiliar and hated sensations. Those who could fled the plane, abandoning their magnificent cities and flying into the cosmos. Their fate, whether they still live or not, remains one of the greatest mysteries of Alaria.

This cataclysmic event marked the end of the second eon. The corpses of the titans who perished on Alaria became great sources of magical power. Even today, these titan remains are incredibly scarce and a source of enormous conflict wherever they are found.

## The Gaeaic Eon (120 million - 7,210 years ago)

In the aftermath of the Ezz Rift, Alaria underwent profound changes. The influx of Ezz caused the spiritual planes to separate from the soul and shadow planes, creating the additional planes: the Ethereal and the Nethereal planes.  While many creatures perished alongside the titans, others survived, adapting to the new mixed atmosphere.

This new planar configuration gave rise to the psywinds and faesong. With Azus and Melera's influence combined, there was a constant whirlwind of exchanging energies among thought and emotion. These were the psywinds and faesong—a roiling sea of thought that permeates all of Alaria, and an ever present melody of every emotion on the planes. These new interactions gave rise to numerous new creatures on Alaria.

### The Birth of Gaea (120 million years ago)

From the ashes of the old world rose Gaea, the Earth Mother. Gaea was the emotion of the land itself, channeling her magic directly from the faesong that now pervaded the world.

Gaea's domain was everywhere, but her power was strongest in the material realm. She bore three sons who would become her protectors:

1. Nagatayora, the First Dragon
2. Ulvma, the First Wolf
3. Shara Bolasi, the First Lion

Gaea's creative power knew no bounds. She populated Alaria with all manner of life: from the majestic mammoths roaming the northern plains to the fierce dinosaurs stalking the eastern jungles, from the resilient scorpions of the deserts to the giant rocs soaring across the skies. However, intelligent life remained absent, with the exception of the enigmatic druids.

### The Druids (120 million years ago)

Alongside Gaea came the druids—an ancient race of beings so attuned to nature that they were believed to be incarnations of the wilderness and life itself. Unlike nearly every other creature born in this period, the druids did not belong to Gaea. Instead, they worked alongside her, their interests often aligning but not always in perfect harmony.

The druids established small villages wherever life flourished on Alaria. They took on the role of caretakers, wielding powerful magic to control and nurture the land. The exact nature of their magic, like Gaeas, was a powerful combination of Azyen and Gaeic song

### The Reign of Dragons (100 - 2.5 million years ago)

Of Gaea's three children, Nagatayora was the eldest and proudest. The species he spawned—the dragons—would prove to become the most powerful creatures since the Age of Titans. During this time, dragons covered all six planes of Alaria, firmly establishing themselves at the top of both the social and natural hierarchies.

Ulvma and Shara also became the progenitors of their respective species, populating the forests and plains of Alaria. As sibling species, the three groups—dragons, wolves, and lions—formed a pact to never prey upon each other. This ancient agreement remains honored to this day, even among their descendants: the Naga, Sharabha, and Ulvsjael.

#### The Walk of Elves (10 million years ago)

Although the druids were immortal, they slowly dwindled in number over time, victims of accidents and conflicts, and unable to reproduce themselves. However, their legacy lived on through their creation: the elves. The druids crafted the elves from the branches of trees, the stones and mud from Alaria's rivers, and a spark of their own life essence.

The elves were made in the druids' image, sharing their pointed ears, slender forms, and graceful movements. They also inherited the druids' deep appreciation for nature and beauty. Gifted in all their endeavors, the elven population quickly grew and spread across Alaria. For many years, they worked in harmony with the dragons, and together, these two races ruled the land.

#### Eyachria the Dragon Goddess (2 million years ago)

Among the dragons, one stood out above all others: Eyachria. She was Nagatayora's favorite, embodying the noblest qualities of dragonkind—honor, trustworthiness, and wisdom. Eyachria held the respect of all Alaria. However, as her eminence grew, so did her secret jealousy of Gaea's position as caretaker of the world.

Eyachria devised a plan to replace Gaea, believing that with time, she could surpass the Earth Mother. For thousands upon thousands of years, Eyachria grew in size and power. After many millennia, her wingspan nearly stretched across the planes. Entire cities flourished upon her back, and she became a continent unto herself.

It was at the height of her power that Eyachria challenged Gaea for the role of Alaria's caretaker. Eyachria could move mountains, breathe fire that could melt entire landscapes, and cast magic powerful enough to reshape reality. Gaea, in comparison, seemed but a whisper in the ground. Eyachria's assessment proved correct—Gaea was no match for her overwhelming might.

However, Nagatayora witnessed this confrontation. Just as he had given life to all other dragons, he possessed the power to take it away. With crushing despair, Nagatayora ended Eyachria's life. The great dragon goddess crashed to the ground, her life extinguished in an instant. To this day, her colossal spine remains visible as the mountain range in the south of Aboyuinzu, a testament to her immense size and a reminder of the consequences of unchecked ambition.

### The Birth of Man (2.5 million - 45,000 years ago)

Gaea, impressed by the success and intelligence of the elves and the druids but also somewhat jealous, set about working on her own creation. Although not as meticulously constructed as the elves, the determination that fueled Gaea's craft flowed into her new creations. From her work spawned the beastmen and humans.

#### The Golden Age of Man (200,000 - 75,000 years ago)

Of all the races born from Gaea, humans proved to be the most versatile and ambitious. It was not long before they had spread to every corner of Alaria, ushering in the Golden Age of Man—a remarkable period lasting 125,000 years of flourishing civilization.

During this time, technology reached incredible levels that have never been matched since. Flying machines soared across the skies and even beyond the planes. Civilizations stretched from the deepest seas to the highest clouds. Magical knowledge became common and plentiful, with humans mastering various forms of magic, including Old Magic, Spirit Magic, and the emerging Avatar Magic.

This era also saw the rise of the daemons of Celesté. As Gaea's children explored the world, they began to understand the nature of the bond between Celesté, the material realm, and the psyic energy enveloping them both. People began moving across the planar boundary in droves, dramatically shifting the population away from the material realm to Celesté.

#### The God War (75,000 years ago)

As more and more people shifted to Celesté, the number of believers and prayers in the material realm began to dwindle rapidly. This led to a terrifying phenomenon: people across Celesté started to disappear. With the risks of returning to the material realm being too great, many remained in Celesté and fought viciously amongst themselves for followers on the material realm.

The combination of a desperate competition for survival among the daemons and a gross expenditure of power on their followers resulted in total war. Most people died, many others returned from Celesté and hid in isolation, while others continued to fight. The world war raged on for years until a follower of Dyos, in a last desperate act, used all of the power of his god to force an eruption of the Kajiit volcano. This cataclysmic event immediately killed millions more and triggered a volcanic winter that would plunge the world into a multi-millennia ice age.

#### The Long Winter (75,000 - 45,000 years ago)

As life withered and the ice age set in, the small pockets of surviving civilization went into hiding in the mountains. They eked out a meager existence, surviving on lichens and hunting the hardy animals that roamed the frozen surface. No daemons survived this period, as residents of the material realm lost all faith in their gods.

The Long Winter also took a heavy toll on the dragon population. Hundreds perished, unable to adapt to the harsh conditions. Many of those who survived became terrifying predators, terrorizing the skies and hunting anything that could be found. Technology regressed to a primitive state once more, with much of the knowledge from the Golden Age lost to time.

### The Age of Craggus (45,000 - 30,000 years ago)

The Age of Craggus began when a young man named Craggus, along with a group of devoted followers, successfully completed a perilous journey to Celesté. Their tribe, which remained alive in the material realm, began spreading the word of Craggus, who grew in power and slowly began to lift civilization out of despair. Craggus became the first new Daemon, earning the title of god of all men.

#### The Rise of the King (45,000 years ago)

Over the next thousand years, Craggus' name became more and more renowned. Through magnificent effort and the power granted to him by his followers, he managed to push back the ice age, ending millions of years of desolation. Craggus was hailed as a hero and became the sole god of the material realm.

#### Craggus' Reign (45,000 - 30,000 years ago)

The next fifteen thousand years were marked by Craggus' kingship among the daemons of Celesté. Although society returned to a state of frequent war and conflict, and others joined Craggus in Celesté, he remained the king of all, and Alaria remained relatively stable under his rule.

During this period, technology once again advanced, climbing back to an industrial level as people relearned how to harness the power of aetherium. This was also a fortunate time during which the ominous killing moon remained dormant for the entire duration of Craggus' reign.

### The Lost Ages (30,000 - 10,209 years ago)

Less is known about the Lost Ages, as this period was marked by years of hardship and despair. Craggus' reign came to an abrupt end with the onset of a catastrophic event known as the laughing plague.

#### The Laughing Plague (30,000 - 28,800 BSD)

The laughing plague was a brutal disease that originated from the plane of Glyssen. How it managed to cross over to Alaria remains a mystery, but its effects were devastating. The plague slowly drove all those exposed to it into a fevering, maniacal madness that incited them to commit horrible acts of violence, all while uncontrollably laughing.

The disease spread through prolonged exposure to the sound of the laughter, bringing nearly all of Alaria to bloodthirsty insanity. A desperate fight for the survival of life on Alaria began, with creatures forced to turn on their own kin who had been infected. For 1,200 years, the Alarian population dwindled as people went into isolation, and trade and progress ground to a halt.

When the plague finally ran its course, it left the civilizations of Alaria in shambles. Entire cities lay barren—their citizens all dead, fallen by each other's hands. Only those deep underground or in complete isolation survived unaffected. Most written history was lost during this time, and technology once again regressed to a primitive state.

##### The Birth of Dwarves

A few among the population held a natural resistance to the corrupting plague. Although they were immune to its violence-inciting effects, the disease stunted their growth and fundamentally and permanently changed those who survived it. These individuals became known as dwarves.

##### [Dwarves](Dwarves)

A few among the population held a natural resistance to this corrupting plague. Although they were immune to it's violence inciting effects, the disease stunted growth and fundamentally and permanently changed those who survived it. These men were known as dwarves. Entire communities of those immune formed—many of which were underground.

[Continuation of the previous content...]

Entire communities of those immune to the laughing plague formed, many of which were underground. These dwarven societies became known for their resilience and ingenuity, adapting to their subterranean homes with remarkable skill.

It is rumored that the laughing plague still circulates deep underground in Alaria, among a grotesque race known as the Kackles. The Uline dwarves, a particularly hardy clan, are said to be holding the plague at bay, preventing it from resurging and threatening the surface world once more.

#### Rise of the False God (28,700 - 28,000 BSD)

In the wake of the laughing plague, a period of intense spiritual yearning gripped Alaria. From this desperation arose a being known only as the False God. This entity, neither daemon nor titan, claimed divinity and promised salvation to a world still reeling from the horrors of the plague.

The False God's reign lasted for seven centuries, during which it amassed a following that spread across much of Alaria. Its teachings were a mix of half-truths and outright fabrications, designed to keep its followers dependent and subservient. The False God's power grew with each new convert, feeding off their faith and devotion.

It was only through the combined efforts of a group of heroes, whose names have been lost to time, that the False God's true nature was revealed. In a climactic battle that reshaped the landscape, the False God was defeated, its essence scattered to the winds. The aftermath left a power vacuum that would take centuries to fill, as people struggled to rebuild their faith and society in the wake of this betrayal.

#### Blight of Arcanus (12,000 BSD)

The Blight of Arcanus marked one of the darkest periods in Alaria's magical history. A powerful curse swept across the land, turning the very practice of magic into a deadly endeavor. Those who attempted to use magic found themselves struck down, their life force drained away in an instant.

This catastrophic event brought down entire empires that had relied heavily on magical infrastructure and defenses. The curse's origin remains a mystery, with theories ranging from a backfired ritual of immense proportions to the dying curse of an ancient, wronged being.

The Blight of Arcanus forced a radical shift in how societies functioned, as they scrambled to adapt to a world without magic. This period saw a resurgence of purely physical technologies and a renewed appreciation for non-magical skills and crafts.

#### The Dark Night (12,000 - 11,500 BSD)

Following closely on the heels of the Blight of Arcanus came an even more terrifying phenomenon: The Dark Night. For 500 years, Alaria was plunged into an unnatural, all-encompassing darkness caused by a massive shadowrift—a tear in the fabric of reality that allowed the essence of the shadow plane to seep into the material world.

This period was marked by great fear and loss. The lack of sunlight caused widespread crop failures, leading to famine on a scale never before seen. Nocturnal creatures and beings from the shadow plane roamed freely, preying on the weakened populations of Alaria.

During this time, new forms of navigation and agriculture had to be developed. Bioluminescent plants and fungi became crucial resources, and entire civilizations adapted to life in perpetual darkness. The few magic users who survived the Blight of Arcanus became invaluable, using what little power they could safely wield to create sources of light and warmth.

#### The Oblivion Years (11,500 - 10,400 BSD)

As the shadowrift finally closed and light returned to Alaria, the world faced a new crisis: a near-complete loss of historical information. Whether due to the chaos of the Dark Night, a yet-unknown magical catastrophe, or some other cosmic event, almost all records of the past were erased or rendered indecipherable.

This period became known as the Oblivion Years, as civilizations essentially had to start over from scratch. Languages had to be reinvented, technologies rediscovered, and societies rebuilt from the ground up. It was a time of great innovation born out of necessity, but also one of great confusion and conflict as different groups struggled to assert their own versions of history and culture.

#### The Hel Dynasties (11,400 - 10,900 BSD)

From the chaos of the Oblivion Years rose a series of tyrannical regimes known collectively as the Hel Dynasties. These oppressive rulers, each claiming divine right and cosmic mandate, established themselves as complete overlords of the known world.

The Hel Dynasties were characterized by their brutal efficiency and technological advancements, often at the cost of individual freedoms and cultural diversity. They built vast cities and monuments, many of which still stand today as testament to their power and ambition.

Each dynasty claimed to be the true inheritors of some lost, glorious past, using fabricated histories to legitimize their rule. The period was marked by intense surveillance, forced labor, and the suppression of any form of dissent or alternative belief systems.

The era of the Hel Dynasties came to a cataclysmic end with the arrival of the Killing Moon, a celestial event that would reshape the political and magical landscape of Alaria once more.

#### The Blood War (10,900 BSD)

The Killing Moon's appearance triggered a massive conflict known as the Blood War. This wasn't merely a battle between dynasties, but a chaotic free-for-all as various factions, emerging warlords, and even common people rose up against their oppressors.

The war earned its grisly name from the unprecedented bloodshed that occurred. Forbidden magics were unleashed, ancient weapons were unearthed, and alliances were made and broken in the blink of an eye. The conflict raged across Alaria, leaving no corner of the world untouched by its violence.

In the end, there were no true winners. The Hel Dynasties were shattered, but so too were many of the rebel factions. The world was left in a state of anarchy, with small, isolated communities becoming the norm as people retreated from the devastation of large-scale conflict.

#### Evorkia's Vision (10,400 BSD)

Amidst the chaos following the Blood War, a powerful and benevolent lich named Evorkia experienced a catastrophic vision. In her mystical sight, she foresaw the return of the Titans and the fall of the world to their overwhelming might. Realizing that the world stood no chance without a force capable of resisting the Titans, Evorkia made a fateful decision.

Drawing upon her vast necromantic knowledge and sacrificing a portion of her own spirit, Evorkia created a new race: the orcs. These beings were designed to be fearless warriors, incapable of feeling fear in the face of even the most terrifying foes. However, the process of their creation came at a great cost to Evorkia herself.

In giving the orcs their fearless spirit, Evorkia was left in a precarious situation. Any positive aspects she kept for herself were ones the orcs could not possess. The result was a race of aggressive, fearless, but slow-thinking humanoids. Meanwhile, Evorkia found herself falling into a state of passivity and terror, her once-brilliant mind clouded by fear and doubt.

As Evorkia's mental state deteriorated, her warnings about the return of the Titans went unheeded by the wider world. Eventually, overcome by fear of her own creation, she fled from her research and the orcs, leaving them directionless. The orcs, lacking guidance, escaped into the world, their purpose unfulfilled.

Evorkia's fear drove her to further split her spirit in desperate attempts to regain her former self, but this only served to further deteriorate her mind. She descended into a state dominated by base desires and evil impulses. Today, Evorkia lives in complete isolation, a mere shadow of her once incredible influence, a tragic reminder of the price of unheeded prophecy and good intentions gone awry.

### The Return of Hykravones (10,210 - 10,209 BSD)

Before the mass exodus and death of the titans, one among them chose a different path. Hykravones, known as the Gray Prince, ventured into interdimensional space, disappearing from Alaria entirely. Millions of years passed before Hykravones made his untimely return.

Upon his arrival, Hykravones found a world utterly transformed, barely recognizable as the Alaria he once knew. The sight of this strange new realm, coupled with the absence of his fellow titans, drove Hykravones into a terrifying rage. With god-like power at his command, the Gray Prince began systematically dismantling Alaria.

Gaea's children, alongside several other peoples including the mysterious Vystrilik, rose to challenge Hykravones. The daemons across Celesté attempted to lend their aid, but their efforts were disjointed and ineffective. Many daemons, fearing the loss of their followers and influence, hesitated to commit fully to the fight. By the time they realized the true extent of the threat, it was already too late.

Hykravones' rampage was catastrophic. Nearly all civilization crumbled before his might, and countless daemons perished as their bases of followers were wiped out. The world was thrown back thousands of years technologically, with countless advancements and discoveries lost in the destruction.

After his furious assault on Alaria, Hykravones unexpectedly went dormant. He vanished from sight, never to be seen again. However, legends persist that the Gray Prince still lives, slumbering deep within Alaria's core, destined to one day reawaken and finish his work of destruction.

#### Rebirth of Gaea's Children

In the wake of Hykravones' devastation, a miraculous event occurred. From the blood-soaked soil where Gaea's fallen children lay, new life emerged. Three new races rose from this carnage: the Sharabha, the Ulvsjael, and the Naga. These beings, born from the essence of Gaea's original children, inherited their predecessors' connection to nature but evolved to thrive in the post-apocalyptic landscape left by Hykravones.

#### The Greatest Sacrifice

As Hykravones' destruction neared its zenith, the daemons of Celesté faced complete annihilation. In a desperate bid for survival, many of these divine beings made an unprecedented choice. They abandoned their realm, sneaking back to the material plane and taking on new, mortal forms.

This act of self-sacrifice and transformation gave rise to entirely new races, each descended from a daemon who chose existence over divinity. These new races, born from the essence of former gods, included:

- Gyv: Mysterious beings with an innate understanding of cosmic forces.
- Rusalka: Water-dwelling entities with hypnotic abilities.
- Pixies: Diminutive, mischievous creatures with a strong connection to nature magic.
- Jae-Kai: Known as "spirit wranglers," possessing the ability to communicate with and control spirits.
- Shapers: Recognizable by their silver eyes, these shapeshifters can alter their forms at will.
- Sarakiel: Often referred to as "evil angels of light," these beings wield radiant energy for both benevolent and malevolent purposes.
- Valkyries: Winged warriors with a strong sense of justice and combat prowess.
- Neferati: Red-skinned fire dancers with ram horns, maintaining a deep connection to Gaea.
- Xaphkiel: Cruel angels of darkness, manipulating shadows and negative emotions.
- Children of Anubis: Dog-headed guardians of the dead, tasked with protecting the boundary between life and death.
- Forsaken of Anubis: Rogue vigilantes who broke away from their brethren, using their powers for their own ends.
- Rhea: Gray-blue skinned people with a natural affinity for air and wind magic.
- Sivakr: Silver-skinned elves with the disconcerting ability to steal and manipulate memories.
- Nuun: Dark-skinned traders attuned to either fire or water, often found in desert regions.
- Dark Elves: A now-extinct race of malicious dragon riders, their legacy living on only in myth and legend.

## The Modern Era (10,209 BSD - Present)

The Modern Era, comprising the third and current eon, began in the aftermath of Hykravones' rampage. This period has been marked by the slow rebuilding of civilization and the emergence of new powers and conflicts.

### The Great Expansion (9,950 - 0 BSD)

Not all perished in the cataclysm brought by Hykravones. Those who survived began the arduous task of rebuilding. This period, known as the Great Expansion, saw the gradual spread of the survivors and their descendants across Alaria.

New cities were founded, lost technologies were rediscovered or reinvented, and the new races born from the daemons' sacrifice began to carve out their places in the world. It was a time of exploration, innovation, and the forging of new alliances and enmities.

#### Frost Fall (8,840 - 8,695 BSD)

A significant event during the Great Expansion was the Frost Fall, a sudden and severe ice age that gripped much of Alaria for nearly 150 years. This period forced many civilizations to adapt quickly or perish, leading to significant technological advancements in areas such as insulation, food preservation, and magical heating.

The Frost Fall also saw the rise of the Winterborn, a group of humans who adapted to the extreme cold, developing natural resistances and affinities for ice magic. Their descendants continue to thrive in Alaria's coldest regions to this day.

#### The Return of Dragons (8,104 BSD)

After a long absence following Hykravones' destruction, dragons made a dramatic return to Alaria. Their reemergence was met with mixed reactions. While some saw the dragons as majestic beings of power and wisdom, others remembered the tyranny of draconic rule from ages past.

The return of dragons led to significant conflicts as they quickly began to reassert their dominance over large swathes of territory. This period saw a lot of fiery and bloody battles as various sentient races struggled against draconic encroachment. 

Some societies formed alliances with certain dragon factions, leading to the rise of dragon riders and dragon-blessed warriors. Others developed sophisticated anti-dragon weaponry and tactics. The presence of dragons once again became a major factor in shaping the political and military landscape of Alaria.

#### The World Fire (10 BSD)

The Great Expansion came to a fiery end with an event simply known as the World Fire. This global catastrophe, the exact cause of which remains debated by scholars, saw much of Alaria engulfed in flames. Entire continents burned, seas boiled, and the very air seemed to ignite.

The World Fire lasted for several months, reshaping coastlines, turning fertile lands to ash, and forcing mass migrations. When the flames finally subsided, the world that emerged was dramatically altered. This event is so significant that many calendars mark it as year zero, separating the time before and after the World Fire.

## The Seventh Dawn (0 SD - Present)

The period following the World Fire became known as the Seventh Dawn, symbolizing a new beginning for Alaria. This era has been marked by the rise of new powers, the rediscovery of ancient magics, and ongoing conflicts that continue to shape the world.

### The Dark Ages (0 - 231 SD)

The immediate aftermath of the World Fire plunged Alaria into a period known as the Dark Ages. Resources were scarce, and much knowledge had been lost in the flames. It was during this time that a group known as the Titansworn rose to prominence.

The Titansworn were deoric cultists, believed to be related to the enigmatic Vyanoweir. They sought to reawaken the titan Hykravones, convinced that only the power of the titans could save the world after it had burned. The Titansworn established temples and research centers in the ruins left by the ancient titans, their influence spreading across much of Alaria.

This period of Titansworn dominance came to an end with a great war against their cult. The conflict involved many factions, but notable among the opposition were the forces led by Athatgarun and Raiyurna, whose actions would be remembered in song and story for generations to come.

### The Time Puzzle (312 SD)

In the year 312 of the Seventh Dawn, a peculiar magical phenomenon occurred that came to be known as the Time Puzzle. For a brief period, time itself seemed to fracture, with different parts of Alaria experiencing time at different rates or even in reverse. 

This event led to widespread confusion and chaos, but also to significant breakthroughs in the understanding of temporal magic. The effects of the Time Puzzle can still be seen in certain locations where time flows strangely, and in the emergence of chronomancers—mages specializing in time-based magic.

### The Peak of Hive Elves (400 SD)
By 400 SD, the Hive Elves had reached the height of their power. This unique subrace of elves was known for their collective mind, which allowed them to operate with unparalleled coordination. Under the guidance of their Matron, they expanded their influence across Alaria, establishing colonies deep in forests, mountains, and even underground. Their society thrived on the principles of unity and harmony, but this also led to an insular nature, making them wary of outsiders.

The Hive Elves' dominance was marked by their advanced mastery of Gaeic Magic, which they used to shape their surroundings, creating living structures that were both beautiful and functional. However, their peak also sowed the seeds of their eventual decline, as their rigid social structure struggled to adapt to the changing world beyond their borders.

### The Sivakr's Descent (1700 SD)
The once-proud Sivakr, a reptilian race known for their grand subterranean cities, were driven underground by a coalition of surface nations. This event marked the end of the Sivakr Empire’s golden age, as their enemies, fearing the Sivakr's rapid expansion and technological prowess, banded together to force them back to the caverns beneath Alaria.

For centuries, the Sivakr had relied on their formidable war machines and a unique form of metal-bending magic to maintain control over vast territories. Yet, the alliance of humans, dwarves, and orcs proved too powerful. The Sivakr retreated to the underground depths, where they rebuilt their society, becoming more reclusive and insular, but no less formidable. Today, their mysterious, maze-like cities continue to hold secrets from the world above.

### Tiira's Ascension (1800 SD)
In 1800 SD, a monumental event shook the world when Tiira, a mortal sorceress of unrivaled power, ascended to godhood. Known for her deep understanding of Gaeic and Azyen Magics, Tiira sought to transcend the limitations of mortal life. Legends say she achieved this through a ritual involving the alignment of several celestial bodies, the sacrifice of her own mortal form, and the absorption of ancient, forgotten magics.

Tiira's ascension marked a turning point in magical study, as her newfound divine presence influenced spellcraft and worship across Alaria. She became a deity of knowledge, transformation, and ambition, revered by those who sought to push the boundaries of magic and reality. Her followers, known as the Tiirath, established great academies and temples, spreading her teachings far and wide.

### The Creation of Goblins (1905 SD)
In 1905 SD, the orcish lich Vezzarak sought to create a servile race to aid in his dark ambitions. Using forbidden necromantic and alchemical processes, he created the goblins—small, cunning, and resilient beings designed to serve the orcish hordes. However, Vezzarak underestimated his creations.

The goblins, contrary to his expectations, quickly became unruly, clever, and fiercely independent. They rebelled against their intended masters, escaping into the wilds and forming their own chaotic communities. Though they were initially viewed as mere pests, goblins adapted and survived, carving out a niche in the world. To this day, they are often treated with disdain, seen as an "escaped slave race" born from a misguided experiment.

### Chimea's Invasion (2900 SD)
In 2900 SD, the powerful nation of Chimea embarked on a massive military campaign across the Pelakan Sea, launching an invasion of Gyendoveir and Yystrilik. This marked the beginning of a bloody and protracted war that continues to this day. Chimea, known for its disciplined army and mastery of Azyen Magic, sought to expand its territory and control key trade routes.

The invasion triggered a widespread conflict, drawing in numerous allies and enemies. The war has led to widespread devastation, particularly in the contested lands where constant skirmishes have left the region scarred and divided. Despite numerous peace attempts, the conflict persists, driven by political ambitions, ancient grudges, and the strategic importance of the lands at stake.

### Present Day (3376 SD)
The world of Alaria stands on the brink of significant change. Tensions are high as the war between Chimea and the southern nations shows no sign of ending. The Sivakr continue to bide their time underground, and the Hive Elves remain in their secluded domains, wary of external influences. Meanwhile, the followers of Tiira strive to uncover new magics, and the goblins, ever resourceful, thrive in the shadows of larger societies.

The Seventh Dawn has brought about both prosperity and conflict, with ancient powers stirring and new alliances forming. What the future holds is uncertain, but the legacy of past events continues to shape the present, and the actions of those who walk Alaria's lands now will determine its fate for centuries to come.
