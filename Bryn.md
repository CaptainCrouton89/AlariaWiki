Bryn was once a mortal in a world of darkness. Became a god to shed light and warmth on world. Enchanted on of the [stars](Stars) to be the sun. So long as people continue to pray to Bryn, there will be light. When people pray more, he spends more time in the sky and summer lasts. As people pray less, he fades, and winter falls. There is a natural cycle of prayer where people pray more when it's cold and pray less when it's warm, causing natural cycles and variation.
