There are four Neferati kingdoms, adjacent to each other, known as the Kingdoms of Fire. Although each kingdom is independent (and is actually a monarchy), they frequently work together and make decisions together.

The Kingdoms of Fire are made up of [Gissemari](Gissemari), [Yaif](Yaif), [Kabir](Kabir), and [Wadiyah](Wadiyah).
