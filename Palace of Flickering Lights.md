Marble palace built by a squadron of fallen [Sarakiel](Sarakiel) long ago. Have made their home on surface. Hundred generations later, super fanatical priests. Lost ability to fly, but still have wings. Forbidden to leave palace (too many have been captured/killed, policy has become law has become dogma). Still fighters, but much less so.
