Tags: islands

Inhabited by pelican-riding gnomes, known as the [Ansari](Ansari). No government, just local communities, with shammans and wise-men. Dotted with huts across the islands. Tropical feathers, lots of beautiful scenery, stone arches, lush islands, coral reefs, and a plethora of fish. Trade in colorful feathers (can be transported more easily).

Super rich in undiscovered resources, inlcuding minerals, and gems, though hard to tell. Super agressive and deadly towards outsiders, as people have attempted to epxloit them in the past, and they had to fight back. Now, they are totally closed off, and people who arrive are shot with arrows and usually never seen again.
