[Ghosts](Ghosts) are nothing more than souls without bodies. When the [soul](Life and Death) leaves to the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane), it becomes a husk of energy. Millions of [ghosts](Ghosts) mill about in the astral kingdoms of the dead.

[Ghosts](Ghosts) and [shades](Shades) don't leave the Astral and Malstaric [planes](Planes) because of the high, planar forces pushing souls up and shadows down. Without thread binding them together, they do not cancel out. They also lack the free will to desire to return to the [material plane](Material Plane).
