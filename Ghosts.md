[Ghosts](Ghosts) and shades are the names for the isolated [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death) respectively. When the [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death) leave to the Astral Plane and Malstaris, they become lifeless husks of energy, forever wandering their respective [planes](Planes). Millions of ghost and shade drones mill about in astral and malstaric kingdoms of the dead.
