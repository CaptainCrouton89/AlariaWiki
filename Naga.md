# Overview

Naga make up a long line of [humans](Humans) with dragon blood running in their veins. Every Naga is a distant descendent of Nagatayora, the almighty dragon-father and first son of Gaia. When Shara Bolasi died to Hykravones, Nagatayora flew into a rage and threw himself at the powerful titan. Such was his ferocity and intensity, Hykravones was nearly defeated. But slowly at first, and then methodically, Hykravones beat Nagatayora back, until finally grabbing ahold of each end of the colossal dragon and tearing him in two. As the fiery blood fell, and heated the lands beneath it, the people below transformed and became the Naga that still exist today.
Naga are passionate and determined in all that they set their minds to, and have an incredibly rich culture of art, religious tradition, and philosophy. They also have a profound sense of pride, both for themselves, their culture, and the things they care about. If they feel that any of those things have been wronged, then they will not back down until amends have been made. Their fury is a terrible force to behold.

*Major ability. Quick.*

You may channel your blood of Naga, and transform into a dragon-like form. Your head morphs into the head of a dragon and your scales surface in patches over your skin. While in this form, you gain the following traits:

- You take half damage from fire.
- You gain +1 to defense rolls from your natural, scaly armor.
- You may belch fire, dealing 2d6 damage in a 10-foot cone. You may only use this ability once per transformation. This counts as a quick ability.
- Whenever a creature deals damage to you, you gain one level of enraged towards that creature. If a different creature deals damage to you, remove all other levels of enraged gained from this ability, and add one level towards the new creature.
- You have advantage on skill checks to intimidate others.
- You remain in this form until you spend your action to return to your [human](Humans) form.
