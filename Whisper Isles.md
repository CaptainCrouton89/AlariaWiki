Enchanted to be permanently quiet. Can't cast oaths here, or communicate with sound. A sanctum from Deoric magic. Home to the ruins of [Thergon](Thergon), which was destroyed by the lich hunters know as the [Pity Knights](Pity Knights). The city was corrupted by [Therguros](Therguros), an ancient lich, so the [Pity Knights](Pity Knights) arrived and destroyed everything (including many innocent people). They then used those innocent deaths to prevent all further Deoric from being cast, by silencing the entire area.
