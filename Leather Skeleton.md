Leather skeletons look like horribly malnourished humanoidsâ€”just skin and bones. Usually, the skin has turned dark and looks unhealthy. Leather skeletons were once normal people who have since been infected by leather-worms, which eat all of the flesh of their victims, and control their brains. The hosts will seek out company and try to bite them, thereby transfering the worm-eggs to a new host through the saliva. They can be seen frequently licking their hands and fingers, which they use to scratch people.
