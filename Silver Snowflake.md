An order of ice wizards who reside in a winter fortress at the center of an ongoing blizzard. An orb within the fortess keeps the blizzard going to allow the wizards to train in peace. Each wizard is held to a high standard but within the keep there are higher and lower level wizards. A single high wizard would be considered a worth threat to a city. The head of the order can be comparable in power to other high wizards but historically is much stronger. Wizards are often encouraged to venture out of the fortress and train their magic in hotter environments so that their spells can be effective outside of complementary bioms as well.
