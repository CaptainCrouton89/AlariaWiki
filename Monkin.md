Carnivorous, hominid ape-like creatures. They eat people. Will form groups outside villages and terrorize the inhabitants, hunting and killing them whenever they fenture out into the woods. Can mimic voices well, are intelligent, and are very capable of setting traps and snares for catching people. Don't like facing people head-on.
