[Tamadrez](Tamadrez) is a suffering country, in a brutal diplomatic balance with [Gorath](Gorath). In the south, Gorathi slavers pick up thousands of [Drasnian](Drasnian) [dwarves](Dwarves) a year. These [dwarves](Dwarves) have been sold into slavery by their very own people. Those that flee north are denied into the northern towns due to a treaty between [Gorath](Gorath) and [Tamadrez](Tamadrez) that forbids the Northerners from accepting slaves from the south, in exchange for not being invaded by Gorath. 

Many in the north turn a blind eye to the slaves, but the threat of [Gorath](Gorath) invasion is very real and terrifying, so open dismissal of the treaty could spell disaster for Tamadrez. Once, several years ago, a northern town was found to be harboring hundreds of escaped slaves. A Gorathi warship came by and firebombed the entire city to ash, killing thousands.

[Gorath](Gorath) has not invaded for the primary reason that its forces are already spread quite thin, due to brutal wars along its northwest and eastern borders. Gorath can only profit off of Tamadrez so long as it remains divided.
