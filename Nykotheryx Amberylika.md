An ancient [forest](Forests), once home to the [Dark Elves](Dark Elves). Ancient dragon totems of bone and silver dot the forest. Unbeknownst to many, these totems hold the spirits of powerful dark [elves](Elves). Rather than go to Celesté, powerful dark [elven](Elves) leaders preferred to remain on the material plane. Like daemons of Celesté, the spirits in these totems still have power. Unlike spirits of Celesté, they will not fade upon being forgotten. Those who find their true names are likely to be showered in power as thanks.

Within the forest live the [Luma](Luma), crystaline and irridescent pixies that live among the upper reaches of the forest, and the [Shyoka Saseidi](Shyoka Saseidi), [gnomish](Gnomes) caretakers of the forest.
