### Spirit Whip
Passive ability.
You are in possession of a spirit whip, an ethereal whip 30 feet long that you can use to hurt creatures’ souls, or else drag them towards you. Your whip counts as a light, ranged, slashing weapon. You always have A2 when using this weapon. When you hit a creature with it, rather than deal damage, you may choose to yank the creature spirit towards you. The creature may either come willingly, landing adjacent to you, or else resists, remaining where they are, taking the damage like normal.

### Soul Sight
Passive ability.
You can see on the ethereal plane out to a range of 20 feet. Only living things are visible on the ethereal plane, but you do not need light to see them.
