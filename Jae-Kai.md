### [Spirit](Life and Death) Whip
Passive ability.
You are in possession of a [spirit](Life and Death) whip, an ethereal whip 30 feet long that you can use to hurt creatures’ souls, or else drag them towards you. Your whip counts as a light, ranged, slashing weapon. You always have A2 when using this weapon. When you hit a creature with it, rather than deal damage, you may choose to yank the creature [spirit](Life and Death) towards you. The creature may either come willingly, landing adjacent to you, or else resists, remaining where they are, taking the damage like normal.

### [Soul](Life and Death) Sight
Passive ability.
You can see on the ethereal plane out to a range of 20 feet. Only living things are visible on the ethereal plane, but you do not need light to see them.
