# Overview

Beautiful, angelic creatures. [Race](Races) from the plane of light. Brilliant white wings, glowing white eyes, pale skin, very symmetrical faces. Absolutely hate the [Xaphkiel](Xaphkiel), however, and will stop at nothing to destroy them, regardless of who else gets hurt along the way. Single minded determination, absolute certainty that they are the superior [race](Races) of the entire world. Kind of eugenics-y. Lots of very strict laws. Mono-culture, a bit alien-minded.

They don't interact much with the rest of the world, because they spend most of their time fighting the Xaphkiel among the [stars](Stars). The Sarakiel live in huge, glowing towers above the starsâ€”invisible to those below, but magnificent to behold. They stay clear of the sun to avoid getting burned.

Every once in a while, a child is born with malformed wings, or some other defect. Their wings are clipped, and they are pushed off the tower (presumably to their death).

# Heart Rush

If you wish to play a sarakiel, you would be a sarakiel that was kicked off from the towers in the sky, and somehow survived the fall (with clipped wings, you might be able to survive the fall). Although you have wings, you can't fly.
