At head of city temple is suspended, massive, darkskinned, shirtless angel with massive white wings, and a giant glowing blue sword. He is [Nephrakes](Nephrakes), guardian of the city. Secretly, the patron god of the city returns and inhabits the body to defend the city. When alive, its eyes turn the same shade of blue as the sword.

Temple is served by young, white, black, and gold robed women. Burn incenses all day and night.
