The [Pact of Barrik](Pact of Barrik) is a statue of two [dwarven](Dwarves) kings, standing back to back, one holding a battleax, the other holding a book. These corresponded to the Hephakean and Argysisean kings respectively. 

The statues are said to imbue wisdom in those who spend time aroudn them. Children from both kingdoms would visit the statue, and princes would spend days in meditation around them. When [Argysis](Argysis) was conquered by [Rothogomos](Rothogomos), this was no longer safe, and the tradition died out.
