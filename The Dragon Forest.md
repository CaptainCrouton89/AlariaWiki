The dargon foreset is a small dark wood that became the domain of a famous dark elf beast tamer with an affinity for taming dragons. The tamer filled the forest with all manner of dark dragon as well as other beasts until it was as well fortified as any of the surrounding cities. The forest became a sanctuary for animals and wild things with the dark elf as the keeper of order. After the dark elf passed the older dragons took on the responsibility and continue to maintain order within the forest so that the creatures can live in close proximity peacfully and ward off unwanted civilizations as a united front.
