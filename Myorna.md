## History

Myorna: 50 years ago, [Myorna](Myorna) did not exist. But then, moon [elves](Elves) surfaced from the mountains, declaring that now they wanted to interact with the rest of the world, and trade. Since then, relations have been tenuous. Despite entering into the [Aldriktch trade alliance](Aldriktch Trade Alliance) with its neighbors, discoveries about the nature of moon [elves](Elves) (also known as silver [elves](Elves) here) has made their neighbors wary. More recent terrorist attacks with links pointing back to [Myorna](Myorna) have made their neighbors outright hostile. Even within Myorna there is political unrest. [King Thyolinor](King Thyolinor) brought the kingdom to the surface, but many feel they are unwelcome, and wish to return to the caves from which they came. [King Thyolinor](King Thyolinor) is not without supporters though—many of the settlements closer to the borders have already begun to assimilate into Erasnian (Erasnus) culture, and hope to stay.

Even longer ago, [Tiira](Tiira) was made into their goddess, after Myorna was driven underground by other [elves](Elves). Elves spent thousands of years underground.
