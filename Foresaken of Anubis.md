# Overview

Use powers for less good terms. Rather than allow your ancestral father to weigh the souls, you choose to deliver justice yourself, acting as both judge and executioner. Like your father, you can feed souls to [Ammit, devourer of souls](Ammit, Devourer of Souls). Your father only sends the most corrupted souls to be devoured, however there is nothing stopping you from doing it to anyone.

Feeding souls to Ammit is dangerous, for ammit is hungry, and sometimes takes more than you offer him.

### Traits

#### Ammit's Justice
*Major ability.*

You begin to feed a still living personâ€™s [soul](Life and Death) to [Ammit](Ammit, Devourer of Souls). You may spend an action to cause an incapacitated creature that you are touching to decrease its heart any number of times. Then roll 1d6. If the result is less than the number of levels you removed, you lose an equal number of levels of your own heart die. If a creature would have its heart die decreased and it cannot fall any further, it instead falls to 0 hitpoints. If the creature is already at 0 hitpoints, or would lose two levels of its heart die while at its minimum, it dies.
