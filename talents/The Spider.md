*Passive ability. Influence.*

You have a network of spies and informants at your fingertips. Once per day while within a city within the range of your influence, you may meet with your informants to learn what is going on around town. You may ask two unique questions of the GM. If you meet with them again after a day or more, your spies return with answers. The GM answers one of your questions truthfully, and either gives false information about the other, or else doesnâ€™t answer it at all. Any information that fewer than 25 people know about cannot be answered by your spy network.

You may ask up to three questions, and may ask questions with answers that are known by no fewer than five people. The GM must truthfully answer two of the three questions.
