*Occasional ability. Slow. With GM approval.*

You have traveled the world and met many, many people. When you meet someone who the GM describes as someone you’ve never met, you may choose to claim some connection to them. If you do, the GM will explain how you recognize them, and the nature of your connection. This connection may be as distant as “you saw them drinking in a bar in a neighboring country”, or as close as, “this woman bears a strong resemblance to the thief you killed earlier today, and you suspect she is his sister”. It is possible there is no feasible connection between you and this person. In this case, you may either regain the use of this ability, or take three destiny points. You cannot use this ability to claim connections with people more influential than yourself.

Rather than claim a connection to someone you meet, you may use this ability before actually running into someone. For example, while at a bar in a foreign country, you could claim that you knew a weapon enchanter who lived in this area. If the GM also believes this to be plausible, your connection becomes real (though their location and condition may have changed since the last time you talked with them). If the GM doesn’t believe this to be reasonable, you may choose not to use this ability.
