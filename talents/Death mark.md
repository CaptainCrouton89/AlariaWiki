*Major ability. Instant. Handmagic.*

Whenever you make an [attack roll](Attack and Defense Rolls) against an adjacent creature, you may choose to instead reach out a hand to mark the creature for death. The creature remains marked for the next hour. So long as the creature is marked for death, any creature may add 1d4 to its attack rolls against the marked creature.

When you use this ability, the effect lasts 24 hours. Then choose one:

- You may still make your [attack roll](Attack and Defense Rolls) against the creature, with the bonus damage granted from the mark.
- Add 1d8 instead of 1d4 to all attack rolls against the creature.
