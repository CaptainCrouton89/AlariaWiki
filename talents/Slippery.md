*Passive ability. Martial talent.*

Whenever you make a skill check or saving throw to try to physically dodge a trap or an area effect, you may choose to first dash and fall prone.
Whenever you make a skill check or saving throw to avoid or escape being restrained, you may choose to replace the result of either die with its maximum, after rolling.

Once per round, if you roll doubles on a [defense roll](Attack and Defense Rolls), you may  choose to move 5 feet. If you are no longer a valid target for your attacker, you do not take damage. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from your attacker.
