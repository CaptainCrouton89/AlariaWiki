*Weekly ability. Slow. Handmagic.*

As an action, you may choose creature other than yourself. That creatureâ€™s next roll is replaced with the maximum result on each of the dice, and a complication occurs. At any time, the GM may replace any one of your next rolls with the minimum possible result. The GM may not do so again until you use this ability again.
