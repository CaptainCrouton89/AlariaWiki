*Major ability. Quick. *

Through the favor you hold with your patron, you may channel their power into your weapon, granting it magical properties for the next minute. You may spend a minute in prayer to activate this ability to double its effect. Whenever you use this ability, your weapon takes on features that resemble the values of the patron you worship, and you get +2 on all of your attack rolls.

You may forgo the +2 bonus that this talent provides, and instead work with your GM to develop a custom weapon ability fitting to your patron. You may take this destiny level multiple times, working with your GM each time you do so.
