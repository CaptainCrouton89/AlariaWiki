*Major ability. Cognitive talent.*

You can suss out information from someone even without them knowing. If you spend 10 minutes talking with someone, you may ask the GM one thing about them that they aren’t trying to hide from the following list:

- Profession
- Childhood
- Moral compass

If you wish, you may press further and make a presence check contested by their cunning challenge number. This check is made with disadvantage if they are unfriendly or hostile towards you. On a success, you learn any one specific piece of information that the target knows and is not actively hiding. On a fail, they know that you are fishing for information about your topic.

You do not make this check with disadvantage against unfriendly creatures, and you make the check with advantage if it’s against a friendly or neutral creature. In addition, if you fail, the creature does not know that you were probing for details on your topic.
