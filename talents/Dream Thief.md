*Passive ability. Handmagic.*

By spending one minute concentrating on the mind of someone else within 10 feet, you can pull thoughts from their mind. Make a contested cunning check against another character. On a success, you may ask one yes or no question about what they are thinking. On a failure, they know that you tried to break into their mind. You cannot steal dreams from the same character more than once a day.
