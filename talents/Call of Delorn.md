*Monthly ability. Slow. Gaeic melody.*

You play a song, making a plea to the wilds for their help. After playing your instrument for an hour or more, a friendly, non-sentient animal comes to your aid. The animal is not your servant, but will do its best to help you in any way that does not put itself in danger. You may communicate with it through your song, though the animal cannot communicate back. The animal remains in your aid for the rest of the day.
