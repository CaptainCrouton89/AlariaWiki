*Passive ability. Handmagic.*

You can communicate with plants, so long as you are touching them. Plants recognize you as an ally, and will generally be willing to help in any way they can.

If you speak in an area of dense vegetation, such as a [forest](Forests), plains, or garden, you may choose for your voice to carry as whispers in the blade of grass or leaves on the trees to everywhere within the reaches of that vegetation, up to a 100 mile radius. Likewise, you may choose to listen to any sounds or voices within 100 miles, so long as you are both in the same larger body of dense vegetation.

If you have the destiny level of the Druidâ€™s Touch talent, you may speak while transformed as a plant.
