By mashing up bark, roots, some berries, and other ingredients from the wilderness, you can create pastes and potions with variable effects. Brewed items go bad after one day, at which point they have no effect. Brewing a potion requires a fire and 10 uninterrupted minutes of preparation. When you forage, you may forgo a day’s worth of rations gathered to instead gather ingredients for your potions.

When you brew, choose one
- Misty Sights: This paste will incites a visions when chewed up and eaten. Upon consumption, choose one subject. You then have a series of three visions, one from the past, one from the present, and one of the future. One of those vision will be of your chosen subject. Those visions may be vague or ambiguous. 
- Ghost Brew: If you consume this potion, you take three levels of dazed and can see onto the ethereal plane for the rest of the day. The levels of dazed end when the day ends. Consuming this once every day for seven consecutive days transports you to the ethereal plane. 
- Crow’s Breakfast: When poured out into a bowl, any crows in the area will come to drink over the course of the next hour. Crows that drink gain the ability to speak common until midnight or noon, whichever is soonest.

You may brew the additional, following potions:

- Death’s Cradle: After being drunk this potion will cause convulsions after 36 hours, followed by death 12 hours after, so long as Swamp’s Tears is not consumed within that time. This potion tastes of earthy mushrooms.
- Swamp’s Tears: This potion cures Death’s Cradle when ingested. It is flavorless.
- Potion of Charms: If a creature consumes this potion, they gain two levels of charmed towards you. The charm effect lasts one hour, and ends early if you attack them. This potion tastes like citrus.
