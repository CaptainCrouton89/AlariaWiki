*Heart ability. Slow. Handmagic.*

While holding a single, non-living object of homogenous material in your hand, you can choose to make it immovable. It remains transfixed in space in relation to the nearest ground beneath it until you let go of it.

<div class="destiny-level">Destiny Level</div class="destiny-level">

You may choose whether the object remains fixed in relation to you, or your immediate surroundings.
