*Passive ability. Martial talent.*

You automatically succeed at the application check whenever you attempt to apply a contact poison (or any other substance) to a weapon.

By combining different contact substances, you have found you can combine their effects, for increased potency. If you apply a dose of two or more different types of contact poisons, you may combine their non-damaging effects, and take the damaging effect from any one component poison.

You have developed the weapon technique to deliver poison more efficiently. Whenever you apply contact poison (or any substance with a contact effect) to a weapon, you may use two doses of each substance used to have the substance take effect possibly beyond the first strike. After each attack, roll 1d6. On a 4, 5, or 6, the poison stays on your blade. On a 1, 2, or 3, the poison is used up.
