*Weekly ability. Slow. Oath.*

True magical healing has a steep cost. You may spend one minute with your hands on another creature with a wound, causing that creature to automatically treat and remove five ranks from any wound. You take 20 damage.

You may use this ability as an action, rather than spending a minute to perform the ability. Remove all ranks of a single wound instead of just five.
