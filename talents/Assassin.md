*Passive ability. Martial talent.*

You have learned the art of killing silently. As an action, you may make a might or agility check against an adjacent humanoidâ€™s agility challenge number. On a success, you either gag them, punch them in the throat, or in some other way remove their ability to speak or shout out. They cannot produce sound for the next minute. If the creature is surprised, you automatically succeed at this check.

Once per month, you may declare a [humanoid](Humans) to be the target of your assassination. So long as that creature is unaware of your existence and never learns you are an assassin, they remain marked.

Given you spend one month studying the target of your assassination before attempting to kill them, you learn their weaknesses, and gain the following abilities:

- You have advantage on all attacks against them.
- If you surprise the creature, you may silence the creature without using your action.
