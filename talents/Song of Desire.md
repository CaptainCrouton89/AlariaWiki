*Weekly ability. Slow. Gaeic melody.*

After playing your instrument for a minute or more, you may choose a creature within 60 feet and in earshot. It feels an inexplicable amiability towards a creature of your choice. They cannot willingly attack that creature unless that creature acts with hostility towards it. If they were hostile, they become neutral. If they were unfriendly, they become friendly. If they were neutral, they become close. This effect lasts for the rest of the day.

That creature gains three levels of charmed towards that creature until the end of the day.
