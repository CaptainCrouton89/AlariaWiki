*Passive ability. Martial talent.*

When rolling agility to avoid fall damage, double your roll. If a creature would be knocked into you, you may instead dodge and have that creature continue past you.

You automatically succeed any check to avoid falling prone. So long as you are not restrained, you may immediately stand up if you are knocked prone, at no cost of movement, and even during another creatureâ€™s turn.
