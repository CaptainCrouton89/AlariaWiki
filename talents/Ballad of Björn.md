*Weekly ability. Slow. Gaeic melody.*

After playing your instrument for a minute or more, you may choose any number of creatures within 60 feet and in earshot. They lose all levels of frightened and charmed if they had any, and are immune to both conditions for the next 24 hours.

A mere strum on your instrument is enough to reinvigorate those who can hear it. You may use this ability as an action rather than spending a minute of playing.

In addition, those effected by the spell gain hitpoints equal to the maximum of your presence die.
