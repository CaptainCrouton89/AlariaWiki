*Passive ability. Cognitive talent. Elemental attunement: Water.*
 
You can manipulate the water in the air to create realistic illusions. As an action, you may make an illusion of a single object up to a range and total amount of space equal to the restraints on your ability to create and manipulate fog through your water attunement. It cannot be seen through, and creatures will not realize that it is an illusion until they have interacted with it in some way, at which point the illusion fades from their sight. Illusions can be hidden behind if the illusion is of another object; they cannot be illusions of darkness, or empty space. 

If a creature has reason to suspect it is an illusion, such as if something suddenly appears or disappears, they may make a cunning check contested by your cunning challenge number. On a success, they see through the illusion.

By agitating the molecules in the air, you can also cause the illusion to emit realistic sounds of your choice. You may manipulate the image and sounds with an object interaction.
