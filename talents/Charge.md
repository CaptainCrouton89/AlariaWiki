*Passive ability. Martial talent.*

Whenever you move 20 feet or more in a straight line towards the enemy and immediately engage them with a heavy melee weapon, they are knocked prone regardless of if they are hit. The enemy must be no greater than one size larger than you. For every 20 feet of distance you charge, you deal an additional 1d6 damage, up to 3d6 damage.

If they are hit as well as knocked prone, you may make an opportunity attack as well.
