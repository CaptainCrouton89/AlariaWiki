*Major ability. Slow. Oath.*

Through ritual magic, you know how to raise the undead. By sacrificing a creature, you can reanimate another creature of the same type. The ritual takes one hour, and at the end you have a creature with stats identical to the dead creature, with the same might die, d2 cunning, agility, and presence dice, half as many hitpoints, and no ability to communicate. It loses any special combat abilities it had, and obeys any orders you give it to the best of its ability. You can have no more  than one undead creature under your control.
