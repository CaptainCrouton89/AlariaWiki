*Weekly ability. Slow. Oath.*

You may teleport to another plane. You take 90 damage. If this causes you to take a lingering injury, your lingering injury is “Planar dizziness” at rank five, and it affects your ability to concentrate and think straight. Should you get this same lingering injury again, increase its rank to five, and reroll the d6 to determine how long the aspect takes to decay.
