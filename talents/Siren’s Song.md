*Weekly ability. Slow. Gaeic melody.*

After playing your instrument for a minute or more, all creatures within 60 feet and in earshot are enthralled with your performance, and struggle to pull their gaze away. So long as you play and they are not in obvious danger, they will approach you up to 10 feet, and will not pull their gaze from you. They have D3 on checks to notice their surroundings.
