*Major ability. Slow. Oath.*

As an action, you may cut open your hand, taking 20 damage, and utter an oath, swearing vengeance against any creature that you believe has wronged you. You can only have a bloodoath against one creature at a time. While you have sworn vengeance against a creature you always know where the creature is, and whenever you engage with or make an opportunity attack against the creature you gain a rush point at the beginning of the next round.
