*Passive ability. Handmagic.*

You can sense basic intentions and communicate simple ideas with wild animals. When you take this talent, you may choose to limit this ability to only one type of wild animal, such as ravens, spiders, or wolves. If you do, those creatures will never attack you and you have A3 on all interactions with those creatures.

As an action, you can summon forth wild animals in a mile radius. If you have chosen a specific animal, you gain exclusively that animal instead.
