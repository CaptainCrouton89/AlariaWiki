*Passive ability. Martial talent.*

If you would make an attack against an adjacent, restrained creature, you may instead attempt to choke that creature. Make a might or agility check versus the creatures agility or might challenge number (it gets to choose). If the creature is larger, you have [disadvantage](Advantage and Disadvantage) for each level of size difference. If the creature is smaller, you have [advantage](Advantage and Disadvantage) for each level of size difference. On a success, you begin choking the creature, dealing 1d6 damage at the start of each of the creatureâ€™s turns, or whenever it moves or takes an action.

The creature may attempt to break free of the grapple by spending an action to make a might or agility check versus your might or agility challenge number (your choice). Size has the same effects on [advantage](Advantage and Disadvantage) and [disadvantage](Advantage and Disadvantage), but in reverse. On a success, they are no longer being choked.

You cannot choke creatures that do have a throat.
