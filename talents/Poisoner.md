*Passive ability. Cognitive talent.*

So long as you can disguise it as another action, you automatically succeed on any check to slip poison into someoneâ€™s food or drink, even while in plain sight of them. This does not guarantee that they will not notice there is poison in their food, only that they will not realize that you are poisoning the food as you do it.

For every 10 times you digest a single type of poison, you develop a slightly higher tolerance for it, and take 10 damage less from every instance of damage it deals.

You know your poisons. You immediately know if any food or drink you eat contains any poison, as well as all of its properties.
