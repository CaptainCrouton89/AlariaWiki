*Passive ability. Cognitive talent. Elemental attunement: Fire.*

Fire you create uses a d8 to deal damage, rather than a d6. You may continue to take this talent again to increase the die size by one until it has reached a d12.

By focusing your channeling of heat, you can even melt non-flammable materials. If your damage die is a d8, you can melt non-magical metals at a rate of 1 cubic foot per 10 minutes. If your damage die is a d10, you may also melt non-magical stone at the same rate. If your damage die is a d12, you may melt the same amount of material in only a minute.
