*Passive ability. Handmagic.*

Choose an animal. It has a d6/d4/d2/d2 stat block, 20 hitpoints, and a d6 heart die. You can communicate simple ideas with it from a distance using verbal and somatic commands, and can spend an action to magically communicate with it when it is within an arm’s reach. The animal obeys all your commands, and takes its turn at the same time you take yours during combat. 

Your companion can only enter engagements that you are already part of. Rather than choosing a stance and rolling a separate attack for your companion, add 2 to your attack rolls when you are in an engagement together. 

If your companion dies, you can either perform a major ritual to bring it back to life, as dictated by the GM, or spend a week in the wild hunting and searching for a new animal companion.

You can see through your companion’s eyes, and hear through its ears. While doing so, you lose the senses on your own body.
