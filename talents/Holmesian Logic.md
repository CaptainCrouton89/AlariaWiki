*Passive ability. Cognitive talent.*

Whenever you spend 10 minutes examining a creature, object, or location, you can produce a random fact about the thing, pertinent to a topic of your choice. You cannot identify anything more using this talent until a significant amount of new information presents itself. You do not forget the knowledge contained in any information you read or hear.

When you use this ability, you may also ask one yes or no question about the thing you see, which the GM must answer. It must be something factual, rather than a question about an opinion or belief.
