*Passive ability. Martial talent.*

You have learned how to attack with your shield and use it as a proper weapon itself. Your shield becomes a bludgeoning weapon of weight equal to the weight of the shield. If you would push a creature while attacking with your shield, the target is pushed 5 additional feet.

You may choose to hunker behind your shield, to increases your defenses. When you take the defensive stance, you take one fourth as much damage, rather than half.
