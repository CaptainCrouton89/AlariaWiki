*Passive ability. Martial talent.*

Make a might or agility check versus the creatures agility or might challenge number (it gets to choose). If the creature is larger, you have [disadvantage](Advantage and Disadvantage) for each level of size difference. If the creature is smaller, you have [advantage](Advantage and Disadvantage) for each level of size difference. On a success, the creature gains a level of restrained. Your movement is decreased by half of its move speed so long as you are grappling it.

The creature may attempt to break free of the grapple by spending an action to make a might or agility check versus your might or agility challenge number (your choice). Size has the same effects on [advantage](Advantage and Disadvantage) and [disadvantage](Advantage and Disadvantage), but in reverse. On a success, they are no longer restrained. You may let go of them at any time. You must have at least one hand free to use this ability.

They gain two levels of restrained on a successful grapple instead.
