*Passive ability. Martial talent.*

You can choose to fire your ranged weapon rapidly, at the cost of your accuracy. Whenever you are in an engagement with a ranged weapon and you have multiple valid targets, you may make your first attack roll with an additional 2d6. If you do, treat half of your result, rounded up, as the attack roll against each of two different valid targets. Any penalties for attacking one of them individually apply to your entire roll.

Roll an additional 4d6 instead.
