*Heart ability. Instant. Cognitive talent.*

After entering an engagement, but before anyone declares stances, you may use this ability. Announce a stance, and a creature in the engagement. Once stances are revealed, any [attack roll](Attack and Defense Rolls) against the creature made using the announced stance ignores half of the target’s [defense roll](Attack and Defense Rolls).

Ignore the creature’s entire [defense roll](Attack and Defense Rolls) instead.
