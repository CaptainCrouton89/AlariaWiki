*Heart ability. Instant. Cognitive talent.*

After entering an engagement, but before anyone declares stances, you may use this ability. Announce a stance, and a creature in the engagement. Once stances are revealed, any attack roll against the creature made using the announced stance ignores half of the target’s defense roll.

<div class="destiny-level">Destiny Level</div class="destiny-level">

Ignore the creature’s entire defense roll instead.
