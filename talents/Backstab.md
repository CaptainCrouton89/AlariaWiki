*Heart ability. Instant. Martial talent.*

If you and another ally are opposite to each other with an enemy directly between you (you can draw a line from a single corner of your space to every corner of the ally’s space such that the line passes completely through the enemy’s space), and the enemy makes an attack roll against your ally, you may add 1d12 to your next melee attack roll against that enemy until end of turn. You must be wielding an ultralight weapon to gain the benefits of this ability.

You may add 1d20 instead.
