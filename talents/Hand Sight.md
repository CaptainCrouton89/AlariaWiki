*Passive ability. Handmagic.*

When you touch an inanimate object, you may choose to mark it. While marked, you can see, hear, and smell from the point on the object that you touched. While sensing through the object, you cannot sense through your own senses. The object remains marked until you mark another object.

You may mark up to three objects at a time, and the source of your senses can originate from any point on the object within 5 feet of where you touched it.
