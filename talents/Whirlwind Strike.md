*Major ability. Instant. Martial talent.*

When you make an attack roll against an enemy using a melee slashing weapon, you may make the attack a whirlwind attack. If you do, creatures of your choice within melee range must make a defense roll against your attack roll and take the damage as well. This only counts as making one attack.
