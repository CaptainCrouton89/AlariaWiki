*Passive ability. Handmagic.*

By molding and sculpting the air, you can create and shape intricate, small objects out of glass from thin air. These objects must be no greater than a 1-foot cube, and they will evaporate into air again if you create another object. You can achieve nearly any level of detail with the objects, but with more complexity, the object will take more time to make.

The size limit on the object increases to a 5-foot cube.
