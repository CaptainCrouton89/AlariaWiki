*Passive ability. Handmagic.*

If a single, contiguous piece of rope is held in your hands, it can be controlled in any way you wish, as if it were an extension of your arm, including floating straight up. It is not strong or dexterous enough to wield a weapon. The control persists only while you hold the rope. The rope can be of length up to 50 feet.

The rope becomes unbreakably strong while being held, and it can extend up to 200 feet long.
