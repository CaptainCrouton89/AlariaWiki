# Magic Systems of the World

Magic in this world stems from various origins, each with its own rules, sources, and limitations. These can be broadly categorized into three types: **Old Magic**, **Spirit Magic**, and **Avatar Magic**. Each has a distinct source, nature, and historical context, influencing how societies and cultures view and use them.

## Old Magic
Old Magic is the original form of magic, created by the primordial gods **Azus** and **Melera**. It is known for its immense, almost infinite power, but also for its complexity and difficulty in learning. Mastering Old Magic is a rare feat, reserved for the most devoted practitioners who are willing to dedicate their lives to understanding its nuances. There are three main subtypes of Old Magic:

### Azyen Magic
- **Source**: Power from Azus, one of the old gods, who embodies idividualism, patterns, and logic.
- **Nature**: The magic is seemingly random but relies on learning a precise pattern of thoughts. Practitioners must train their minds to replicate a complex, delicate sequence—like a mental form of dance or meditation. Mastering Azyen Magic involves clearing one’s thoughts and then following a strict mental pathway, much like memorizing an impossibly intricate melody.
- **Usage**: Extremely versatile, but hard to control. Practitioners, known as **Magi**, must learn to think like Azus, and even a minor deviation in the sequence can disrupt the spell.
- **Challenges**: Learning to manipulate Azyen Magic is akin to mastering an impossibly difficult instrument—one wrong move, and the magic can unravel.

### Gaeic Magic
- **Source**: Melera, on of the old gods, who embodies harmony, change, and emotion.
- **Nature**: Practitioners sing or play melodies that resonate with Melera’s power. It is infinite but requires deep emotional connection and understanding. The magic flows naturally, but only when the caster aligns their intentions with Melera’s will. This type of magic is fluid, almost alive, and reacts unpredictably if not handled correctly.
- **Usage**: Gaeic magic is most commonly used in rituals, blessings, and nature spells. Those attuned to it, called **True Bards**, can do nearly anything, but only in a ways that follow the same sort of strange logic of Melera.
- **Challenges**: The spells often work only if they align with Melera’s vision. Forcing the magic to act against this flow can lead to disastrous consequences, making it unreliable for those with ulterior motives.

### Creature Magic
- **Source**: Creatures born with innate magical abilities that derive from Old Magic.
- **Nature**: Some beings, by their very existence, embody the magic of Azus or Melera. This is seen not as “learned” magic but as a natural trait, similar to how some species have enhanced longevity or strength. For example, a creature might innately know Azyen Magic’s patterns or naturally resonate with Gaeic melodies.
- **Usage**: This magic is automatic, integrated into the creature’s being. It’s not something they control consciously, but rather an aspect of their nature, like an elf’s longer lifespan or a dragon’s breath.
- **Challenges**: Because it is inherent, creature magic cannot be taught or transferred. It is simply part of the creature’s essence.

## Spirit Magic
Spirit Magic operates by channeling energy from spirits, often through rites or invocations. Unlike Old Magic, Spirit Magic has roots in the mortal world, born out of the need to harness power from beyond the physical realm. It can be viewed as a more accessible form of magic, though not without its ethical and practical concerns.

### Deoric Magic
- **Source**: Magic drawn from the practitioner’s own life energy, or forcibly taken from others.
- **Nature**: A dark, forbidden form of magic, developed independently from the gods. It involves sacrificing one’s own reserves of energy, or in darker practices, the life force of others. It has a bad reputation, often referred to by critics as “speaking in blood-verse” due to the cruel practices associated with its rituals.
- **Usage**: Practitioners, or **Deorics**, can perform powerful spells, but at a high cost. It is common in the darker corners of society, where magic-users are willing to trade life for power.
- **Challenges**: The use of Deoric Magic requires intense focus and willpower, as it drains the caster. It is also a controversial practice, banned in many regions due to its association with blood magic and sacrifice.

### Handmagic
- **Source**: Draws from the regenerative life force of ancient titans, inscribed through Deoric runes with the titan blood and bones.
- **Nature**: A specific type of Deoric Magic, involving the tattooing of runes into the caster’s body. These runes tap into the power of long-dead titans, granting all varieties of magic ability. 
- **Usage**: Handmagic is used by nearly anyone who can afford it.
- **Challenges**: The process of getting a tattoo is painful, and if the strength of your spirit cannot contain the titan's magic, you will perish.

### Divine Magic
- **Source**: Spiritual energy collected from prayers and devotion, combined with Deoric practices.
- **Nature**: Unlike the darker forms of Deoric, Divine Magic is considered benevolent. It collects fragments of spirit energy given freely through prayer, which are then used by gods in combination with Deoric methods. Since it is a voluntary exchange, it lacks the cruelty associated with other spirit-based magics.
- **Usage**: Gods, priests, and holy figures use Divine Magic to do whatever they want. Because the energy comes from willing devotees, the magic is seen as a gift from the gods, rather than a forced exchange.
- **Challenges**: The power of Divine Magic is tied to the faith and devotion of followers. A god with fewer followers will have less energy to work with, limiting the scope of spells.

## Avatar Magic
Avatar Magic involves interacting with other planes of existence, channeling energies and entities from these dimensions. Practitioners serve as conduits between the material world and other realms, giving them access to powers that ordinary mortals cannot touch.

### Kethic Elementalism
- **Source**: Elemental planes that represent fire, water, earth, air, and other natural elements.
- **Nature**: Practitioners, known as **avatars**, attune themselves to the elements, allowing them to bend, shape, and manipulate these forces. It is the most direct and physical form of magic, often requiring the user to channel their own physical energy into spells.
- **Usage**: Elementalism is used for combat, construction, and even agriculture, depending on the elements being controlled. Some avatars specialize in a single element, while others can manipulate multiple, though this is rare.
- **Challenges**: Attuning to an element requires a deep, spiritual connection, and intense concentration. It can take years of proximity to an element to build an attuenement to it, and years more to master it.

### Psyic Magic
- **Source**: Psywinds—currents of thought energy flowing through all beings.
- **Nature**: Psyic Magic allows users to interact with the thoughts of others. This can manifest as telepathy, mind-reading, or even manipulation of memories. Practitioners, known as **syncopaths**, must learn to navigate the delicate web of thoughts without causing harm.
- **Usage**: Commonly used by diplomats, spies, and healers. It can help resolve conflicts or bring peace to troubled minds, though it is just as often used for subterfuge and control.
- **Challenges**: The mental strain of navigating others’ thoughts can be overwhelming, and other people's thoughts can influence your own when you open your mind to the winds.

### Fae Magic
- **Source**: Faesong—resonant energy that taps into the emotions of living beings.
- **Nature**: This magic allows users to interact with the feelings of others, enhancing, dampening, or even creating emotions. Like Psyic Magic, it requires a delicate touch, but it focuses more on the heart than the mind. Practitioners, also called **syncopates**, are trained to use their own emotional state as a tuning fork to harmonize with others.
- **Usage**: Fae Magic is often seen in performances, art, and healing, as it can elevate the emotions of an audience or soothe a grieving heart. It is also used in more sinister ways, such as controlling a mob or inciting fear.
- **Challenges**: Tapping into raw emotions can be dangerous. Syncopates must be careful not to lose themselves in the feelings they manipulate, as the power can be overwhelming and addictive.
