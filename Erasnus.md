## Military

**Enrollment**: Mandatory

- Military enrollment is mandatory, but there are a thousand ways to wiggle your way out of it, which means that it consists primarily of the poor and less influential.
- Working in the military is seen as a job for idiots who can't turn a profit on their own. 
- As tensions heat up between [Anarak](Anarak) and [Myorna](Myorna), [Erasnus](Erasnus) is scrambling to not get swallowed up if war should break out.
- The population is largely non-violent. If threatened with a sharp stick, most Erasnuns would throw up their hands and give over all of their money. Most see it as much easier to trade to make money rather than risk getting hurt stealing.

## Primary Conflicts

- [Myorna](Myorna) and [Anarak](Anarak) are both potential sources of war, and Erasnus' military is terribly ill-equiped to handle a war, should it break out. They are currently desparately trying to negotiate peace treaties, and although things look good on paper, there is a lot of uncertainty.
- The military is largely disrespected, but those at the head of it do control a considerable amount of power, which they could wield to wrestle some control from the nobility and merchants, who have scorned them forever.
