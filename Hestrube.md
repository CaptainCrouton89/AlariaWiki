Gray [dwarves](Dwarves) live far deeper in the ground than summer [dwarves](Dwarves), and most have never seen the light of sun. Instead, they have found their home in underground lakes and caverns, feeding off of algae, fungus, and the creatures that live in the dark. Gray [dwarves](Dwarves) are very distrusting of outsiders, and the few gray [dwarves](Dwarves) that leave the confines of the deep underground rarely return. Those who do face an alien world that changes far faster than the slower, more plodding life deep underground.
