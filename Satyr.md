### Traits

#### Blood Frenzy
*Major ability. Instant.*

When you kill a creature, you may spend an action to shower yourself in the creatureâ€™s blood, causing you to go into an uncontrollable frenzy. For the next minute, you have A2 on all rolls. 

#### Piper
*Major ability. Slow.*

You have a set of pipes you can play which have magical effect. As an action, you may play your pipes and force another creature to make cunning saving throw against your presence challenge number. On a failure, that creature is charmed by you for the next hour. The charm is immediately lifted if you attack them. When the hour ends, they know they have been charmed.
