## Primary Conflicts

- There is a constant tension between the queen and the Dengar who have left. The queen has to walk a line between being the savior of the Dengar, while also supressing those who escape. The Dengar are stuck between living in a city in the swamp bowing down to a false queen, or else trying to survive in a deadly swamp that they can never leave.


## History

Sixty years ago, the Dengar lived in the swamp, in peace. They were close with many of the beasts of the marshes, and knew how to survive. Then, the gorgon Phendexelas arrived, and the fogs began. At first the fogs were not an issue, but slowly the beasts of the swamp were driven mad, and the Dengar became affected. A city was built by the queen, and the Dengar fled to it, running from a swamp that had turned against them. The gorgon had solved a problem she had created, and now she was the queen of a city.
