Stretching all the way across the material plane, [Zylogmus Eternus](Zylogmus Eternus) is the "infinite labrynth". Houseing all manners of horrors, and plagued by a terrible curse, [Zylogmus Eternus](Zylogmus Eternus) is one of the worst places you can possibly find yourself.

[Zylogmus Eternus](Zylogmus Eternus) is an enormous maze of corridors and tunnels spanning thousands of miles, built on the lower surface of the Material Plane. It has undergone countless modifications and iterations over the eons, and is a hodgepodge of new and old. [Factions](Factions) control various parts of this megadungeon, vying for power, but their borders are constantly shifting, as the fight for territory is fought nearly ceaselessly. Dividing all of it is an invisible grid. Nobody knows exactly where the grid lines pass through, but once every month, a random person from within that grid doesn’t wake up that night, dying painlessly in their sleep. If someone is sacrificed (burned alive) in one of the eternally burning braziers scattered through the labyrinth, that grid square can avoid having a random person killed. 

Up above, there is the Meat Grinder—an impenetrable ceiling of twisting gears and blades. No one has ever gotten through this alive to live the tale. Below, their is the abyss—less explored, more dangerous dungeon. All sorts of rumors exist about what lives the deeper you go, but as with the Meat Grinder, few make it back

Scattered throughout the dungeon are the sacrificier braziers, used to burn those who are given over to the dungeon.

The shadows of the dead come out at night and kill those who are still wandering the hallways. Curfews are enforced.

Many governments have enforced sacrificial pools—they sacrifice those who are weak in order to ensure the safety of themselves.

At the bottom of the dungeon is [Emphathum](Emphathum), and then a long journey through the [Underrealms](Underrealms) to the surface. No one has made it down, as it is guarded by...?

Very few people ever pick up attunements to anything other than the secondary elements, since they spend their entire lives away from stone, fire, fresh air, and clean water.

# History

In a long forgotten time ago, Phlethageros' surface was ruled over by the powerful kingdom of [Trivulin](Trivulin). United, the people of Trivulin faught against the demons above, holding them at bay for centuries. An order of paladins known as the Demon Slayers protected the land, and were perhaps the most noble and powerful order of knights to ever exist in all of [Alaria](Alaria). For a millenia, both the demons of Geth and Trivulin remained neck and neck. 

The delicate balance came to an end, however, when [Xeros](Xeros), the king's brother, betrayed his people and allied himself with [Gorthrusk the Deceiver](Gorthrusk the Deceiver) in order to assassinate his brother and ascend as king. However, [Gorthrusk](Gorthrusk the Deceiver) used his allyship to weaken the empire by accusing the Demon Slayers of treason, having many of them killed for their ficticious crimes. 

Among the demon slayers who remained were the brothers [Averos](Averos) and [Perleus](Perleus). They were determined to avenge the treachery of [Xeros](Xeros), and shortly after he ascended the throne, the brothers murdered him and temporarily claimed the throne for themselves until a new king could be decided. With a crippled order of paladins, and a kingdom's succession in question, the defenses of Trivinum began to falter. By the end of the year, Trivinum survival was in question. 

With no other options, the two paladin brother kings cast two spells with the aid and sacrifice of their kingdom to forever protect their world. The younger brother cast a spell to make an impenetrable wall between their kingdom and the raining hell above, and the elder brother cast a spell cursing the demons to slowly die. 

Unfortunately, one of the most powerful demons infiltrated and corrupted the elder brother's spell, reflecting it upon their own kingdom, cursing them to make sacrifices forever. Eldest brother sacrifices himself in shame as first sacrifice for the kingdom.
