## Geography

The [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) consists of a massive sea with floating islands, consisting of a special stone-like material that floats in Astral solution. Like icebergs, larger islands are cliff-edged, and tower into the sky, while smaller islands ride much lower. Huge disasters occur when an island rolls over due to the massiver earthquakes they deal with (due to structural instability). These quakes can cause astral stone to break free, showering down on the earth. 

The Astral Sea is filled with beautiful shining lights, which are the stars on the [material plane](Material Plane). These lights were created by the titans. The Astral Sea is nearly opaque, which is why the giant islands high in the sky are not visible. The [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) is lit up from above by [Aurus, the White Sun](Aurus, the White Sun), which illuminates all souls on the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane), but cannot penetrate down to the [material plane](Material Plane) through the Astral Sea.

No [maps](Maps) chart these lands, as the islands, as their locations are constantly changing.

Massive cities are built in these islands. 

### The Astral Sea

The mountainous underbelly of the ethereal plane can sometimes be seen from the material realm below. The entire underbelly is covered in colossal mountains which undergo [mountain](Mountains) shaking earthquakes every millennia or so. The rocks that break free and plummet to the material realm during these earthquakes provide the astral stones used for intercontinental travel, due to their strange buoyancy in the Astral Sea. 

## The Soul

The [soul](Life and Death) is slightly influenced by astral currents in the astral sea, and good ship captains can sense them to navigate astral currents well.

The [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) is illuminated by the [Aurus, the White Sun](Aurus, the White Sun) (counterpart to [Nydus, the Black Sun](Nydus, the Black Sun)). Souls are illuminated in its light.

All souls of the living go to the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) upon death. The [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) is composed of a vast sea, dotted with millions of islands, populated with thousands and thousands of the the souls of the dead. *** is the self declared queen of the souls, though dozens of other powerful figures of the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) vie for his position.
