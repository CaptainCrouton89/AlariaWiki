The Amverela are the most prolific and long-living of the elves, and most interactive with the other inhabitants of Alaria. Partially due to their long life times, but especially due to their extreme wisdom, passion, and expertise, the Amverela are some of the longest running ethnic identities among all people on Alaria—having survived numerous cataclysmic events, wars, and famines while remaining relatively culturally intact. 

They place a higher value on investing in themselves, their relationships, and their communities. This has led them to building some of the most magnificent cities in Alaria—utopian, by most’s standards. 

The Amverela can be found across Alaria, and are known for their extraordinary skill in all aspects of life.
