God of the silver [elves](Elves). 

Was forced to become goddess of the elves since she was smartest. Tutored from young age by government and professors. Had her memories wiped (she was bullied and mistreated by silver elves). Knew a lot, was somewhat disliked, but the "chosen one". 

She is beholden to the elves, and does not know her true past.

Once was friends with [Sylthion](Sylthion), a neth(?) man, god of prosperity/etc. Tiira allowed her followers to destroy [Sylthion](Sylthion), thereby causing him to die. Friendship destroyed.
