# Overview

The Caerene have darker, more olive skin than their Zaelian and Amverela cousins, allowing them to more easily blend into the forests in which they usually live. 

Caerene are far more isolating than many other races, preferring to remain unbothered by the trivial, day-to-day grievances and turmoil of most life on Alaria. For that reason, most populations have found hard to reach or find locations as well as methods of hiding and blending in with their natural surroundings. An unobservant individual walking through the middle of a Caerene village may not even be aware anyone is aroundâ€”so skillful are the Caerene. 

Most Caerene culture emphasizes finding balance in nature, and preserving that balance. They place a lot of significance on fate, fairness, and immediate justice. There are no second chances in Caerene culture.
