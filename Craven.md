# Overview

Crow people, refered to as "The Craven". Have feathers, but no wingsâ€”just clawed hands and feet. Crow head. Incredibly smart and fast learners.

# History

Man's attempt at creating intelligent life. Horrible people. Incapable of directly or knowingly killing anything, but must otherwise do exactly as they're told. They are a slave [race](Races) in the parts of the world they inhabit. Some have found ways to throw off the chains of following orders, and although they can't kill people, they take great joy in torturing and bringing people to the brink of death. If any of them actually kill someone, they instantly die.

# Heart Rush

This [race](Races) is not for the feint of heart.
