### Traits

#### Sunsmith
*Major ability. Quick.*

As an Aureum, you are privy to the secret methods of extracting liquid sunlight from the sun’s rays, and you always have a flask of sunlight available. It emits light out to 10 feet, and dim light for 10 feet beyond that. You may use this flask for any one of the following abilities:

- Health and Rejuvenation. As an interact action, you may drink the flask and increase your hitpoints to the maximum of your current heart die.
- Smash. As an interact action, you may crush or throw your flask to cast Blinding Sun.
- Once you have used your flask, you cannot do so again until you spend 10 minutes in private at sunrise or sunset to capture the sun’s rays. The sunlight within a flask expires after 12 hours.
