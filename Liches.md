A lich is a being that has split its [spirit](Life and Death) in two, and usually, is using another beingâ€™s [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death) to remain alive. By binding a piece of its [spirit](Life and Death) to an object, it can survive death by transferring to the [spirit](Life and Death) saved in the object. This has the effect of fragmenting the [spirit](Life and Death) more and more times with subsequent deaths, causing the lich to fade more and more from any sense of humanity. On top of this, the [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death) must be replenished with each new iteration, usually requiring taking the life of another being of similar strength.
