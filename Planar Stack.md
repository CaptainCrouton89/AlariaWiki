A [planar stack](Planar Stack) is a collection of tightly grouped [planes](Planes), usually holding strong connections to each other. 

A [planar stack](Planar Stack) consists of a series of [planes](Planes), clumped together, sometimes in a stack (like in Alaria). While the laws of nature, [magic](Magic), and physics differ from one stack to the next, their overarching structure are generally the same. As one travels from the cosmos to a [planar stack](Planar Stack), to a plane, the number of dimensions steadily decrease.

## Major Planar Stacks

- [Alaria](Alaria)
- [Epyphiozath](Epyphiozath)
- [Instruxofinum](Instruxofinum)

## Glyssen

Glyssen is a spherical ocean of whispers and insanity. Aberrant creatures roam across both the currents and time itself. No one has returned with their sanity intact.

## Klokas

Klokas is a vast void of empty space filled with huge demonic creatures floating through the skies. 

## Narglon

Completely dark, nothing can be seen in Narglon. Those who have returned have come back infected with the darkness itself. Like a horrible, infective liquid of nothingness. 

## Minor Planar Stacks
