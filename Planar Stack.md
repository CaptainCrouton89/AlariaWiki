A [planar stack](Planar Stack) is a collection of tightly grouped [planes](Planes), usually holding strong connections to each other. 

A [planar stack](Planar Stack) consists of a series of [planes](Planes), clumped together, sometimes in a stack (like in Alaria). While the laws of nature, [magic](Magic), and physics differ from one stack to the next, their overarching structure are generally the same. As one travels from the cosmos to a [planar stack](Planar Stack), to a plane, the number of dimensions steadily decrease.
