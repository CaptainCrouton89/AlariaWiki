## Overview

Danaki are infamous for their toughness and their terrifying rage. Danaki have no sense of family, as the baby [minotaur](Minotaur) children are raised by the village. Most do not know who their parents are, nor are they interested in finding out. From a young age, they are taught to fight and kill, usually long before they learn how to read and write.

Danaki are also known for their rage—a berserk [state](States) of anger and pure, single-minded aggression. During a rage, they can behave unpredictably and incredibly violently, and are capable of ignoring many injuries.

Danaki are trained from a young age to express very little emotion, and suppress it if possible. Affection, joy, pain, and sadness are all viewed as signs of weakness, and most claim that they have not felt those things since they were a child. Marriages in Danaki villages are arranged by the village council once each member in the union has been deemed “stable”. Most Danaki view their marriage as a rite of passage to adulthood, a way of showing that you have completed your growth. The marriages are generally for convenience and pleasure, as many aspects of emotion and family have been rooted out.

Although the Danaki inevitably grow attached to one another, they admit it only in confidence, and believe themselves capable of making decisions completely unaffected by that attachment.
