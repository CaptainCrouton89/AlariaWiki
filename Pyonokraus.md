Home to some [Ayblek](Ayblek).

This city is cursed—none of the inhabitants can ever leave, including those who enter from the outside. Built into a titan skull on the mountainside, it has layers upon layers of city built on top of itself, since there's nowhere to go but down and on top of existing buildings. 

It has a similar feel to the mining town in guardians of the galaxy where they meet the bioengineer

It has existed for millenia, and contains secrets completely unknown to the outside world. Getting them, however, is quite difficult; no one who enters can ever leave. You can greet people at the border, but you have to be able to offer something fantastic to make them willing to share—after all, they're screwed, and they have no reason to help you if you can't offer something incredible in return.
