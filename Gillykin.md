### Traits

#### Hoppy (Boi)
*Passive ability.*

Rather than moving any amount of distance up to your move speed, you get two hops each turn. With each hop you may move up to half your move speed. Ignore all difficult terrain, enemies, and opportunity attacks between your starting location and ending location. Whenever you hop, you may forgo any amount of horizontal distance for half as much vertical height. 

#### Amphibious
*Passibe ability.*

You can breathe underwater, and gain a swim speed equal to half your move speed.

If you do not submerge yourself in water for 5 minutes once a week, your skin dries out and you begin to die. For each week that passes without submersion, your maximum hitpoints fall by 20.
