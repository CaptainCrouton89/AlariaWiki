# Overview

Oznak are proud, brave, and competitive, and place a high emphasis on proving one’s self-worth and accruing technical skill with a blade. From a young age, children are taught with sticks how to wield a sword, even if they will never be able to afford a real sword in their lifetime. Most festivals in Oznak-dominated settlements also include different types of competitions involving sword play, and proper tournaments are common in some regions. 

While excelling with the blade garners the most respect, those who don’t become the best are pressured to succeed and dominate in another field. This mentality results in a culture of highly competitive people. Because they value skill so highly, cheating or cutting corners to get to the top is seen as despicable, and is a quick path to getting into a duel with an Oznak.

Oznak can be found across Central North Alaria, though individuals can be found nearly anywhere in the world, and are known for their technical craftsmen, powerful merchants, and terrifying swordsmen.
