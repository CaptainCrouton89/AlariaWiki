## Physical Appearance

Kuzagt have high cheekbones with strange, bony protrusions coming from them. Their features are more angular than other [elves](Elves), and they have more slanted eyes.

## Cultural Overview

The Kuzagt place little value on [human](Humans) livesâ€”seeing them as invaders and poachers on the great beauty that is [Alaria](Alaria). They see nothing wrong with using them to further their own purposes. However, many Kuzagt have taken this too far, and have lost sight of the original, deeper purpose.
