# Overview

Sharabha are the children of Shara Bolasi, the great lion father and third child of Gaia. When Hykravones first arrived on Alaria, Shara Bolasi was the first to step forward, alone, to make a stand against the powerful titan. In the terrible ensuing battle, Shara Bolasi was slowly beaten down, before at last, Hykravones stepped forward and ripped Shara Bolasiâ€™s heart out through his chest, before stomping it beneath his foot. Millenia later, when people had settled across Alaria once more, the humans who ate from the soil there became the first Sharabha.

Sharabha are known for their warmth, compassion, and incredible honor. In Sharabha communities, a lying Sharabha is an exiled Sharabha. The leaders of Sharabha prides, as they are sometimes called, are usually the strongest, most respected member of a pride. They will make unilateral decisions for the pride until a new leader is chosen.

Outside these communities, Sharabha who have willingly left do not practice many of their more traditional rituals, but maintain their fierce sense of principles and morality.

### Traits

#### Aspect of the Lion
*Major ability. Quick*

You may channel your blood of Shara Bolasi, and transform into a lion-like form. Your head morphs into the head of a lion and claws grow on your hands. While in this form, you gain the following traits:

- Your jaws count as a heavy piercing weapon. Your claws count as light slashing weapons. 
- Whenever you deal damage with your jaws to an enemy, you may choose to not let go. If you do, the creature takes four levels of slowed and a level of weakened and off-balanced until you let go, or until it spends its action and wins a might check against your might challenge number. While holding on, you cannot attack with your jaws again.
- You cannot hold a weapon or shield or manipulate fine objects.
- You are immune to the frightened condition.
- You remain in this form until you spend your action to return to your human form.
