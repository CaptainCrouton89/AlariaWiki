Starfall is a pool of intense, other-worldly energy. Just as the soul and shadow provide energy to life in Alaria, Starfall is a pool made of the energy used on a distant planar stack. The energy has naturally coalesced here. It is affected by physical material, but ceases to exist if it's taken far enough away from the lake of it.

The substance is known as starblood, given for it's purple-red color and twinkling lights within. It gives off a deep and alien glow. Sometimes, people who enter the pool never come back. 

The substance is barely contained on Alaria. When removed from the pool, the substance is teleported from the plane and brought back towards its home-planeâ€”[Glyssen](Glyssen). The liquid is the blood of a massive sky worm that escaped the planar stack and came to Alaria where it was promptly disintergrated.
