Tidal dragon. Master of waves, beaches, seas

A neutral dragon. Sailors ask for "Straker's Blessing" when crossing the sea, sometimes, because legend holds that Straker has saved the most courageous and worthy sailors in times of rough seas. 

Possesses a few elemental stones of water and air. Spends most of his time basking on the beach, relaxing among tidepools. Totally unreadable.

Desires to one day encounter a champion worthy to receive his mentorship. Straker once trained heros in the age of champions. Can turn a fighter into the best fighter they can become. Has an assistant [Herexes](Herexes) (Sharabha revenant) who was right-hand man (and lover) of Straker's last [hero](Heroes), and he travels the world searching for another hero to take original hero's (Craggus??) place.
