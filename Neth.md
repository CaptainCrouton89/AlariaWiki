# Overview

Neth are thoughtful and inscrutable, and place a high emphasis on community, ancestry, and wind. It is easy to misinterpret a Neth’s silence at a joke as boredom or even worse, anger, but if you look carefully, you may see a glint in their eyes, and they will soon fire back a joke of their own, all while never breaking a smile. 

Neth are best known for their ability to speak with the wind, allowing them to communicate with the deceased members of their communities to gather advice. The advice and secrets of their ancestors is central to the longevity and power of the many Neth-composed tribes that cover the northern tundras. For this reason, maintaining good relation with one’s family, and community are critical to Neth culture, an outlook and behavior that extends to friends they meet who become close.

Neth can be found across the [Amber Coast](Amber Coast), along the coast, and in the north-eastern regions above Atyeska, and are famous for their sages, soothsayers, and resilient warriors.

#### Speak with the Wind
*Major ability. Slow.*

While outdoors, when the north wind blows, you can hear the voices of your ancestors. Once per day, you may reach out to your ancestors to ask for their guidance. Choose one:

- Questions and Answers: You may ask them up to three questions. They answer to the best of their ability. Although they only know what they knew during their lifetimes, their knowledge spans nearly a millennium.
- Guidance: Define a specific type of task or activity. Once, before the end of the day, before making a roll for that task or activity, you may declare that you are using your ancestors’ guidance. After rolling, you may replace either die with the maximum result of that die.

This entire ritual takes 1 minute.
