Tower of the mad craven mage Yprazi. Hasn't found a way to free himself yet, but has found a loophole in not killing peopleâ€”instead just saps them of their [spirit](Life and Death) and harvests it for magic. Is accumulating a colossal amount in pits beneath his tower. 

He gathers people from the rest of [Free Isles](Free Isles) using Shapers to lure them on to ships and brings them back for harvesting. He then releases them on to the [Hills of the Damned](Hills Of The Damned).
