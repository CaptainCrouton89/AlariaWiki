Each of the four dragon blades is an ancient item that was forged by a dark [elf](Elves) master smith. The blades are a rare example of [elven](Elves) smithing competing with the best of the drwaven and cyclopse craftsmen. Although none of the blades are enchanted, they were made with such skill and such rare material that they posses mythic properties, allowing them to aid the weilder in supernatural ways without the use of conventional magic or mana. The blades where forged for dragon riders of the ancient dark elf empire. The hilt of the blade is modelled after the dragon's maw while the blade its[elf](Elves) is modelled after the dragon's tongue. This design resulted in the swords looking thick, wavey, and slightly sluggish. Their shape combined with their dark materials have led to them being described as crude or unsightly but on the battle field they serve their purpose flawlessly. They swing with speed and ease despite their size and shape and they seperate flesh, bone, and armor alike, without becoming dull. The blades have been scattered and traded over the years but remain legendary items coveted by dark elf establishments.
