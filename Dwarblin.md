Reside in [Watar](Watar).

Half-goblin, half-dwarf, and hated by both equally. Staunch, hearty, chaotic, wise, strong, and friendly, there's not much to dislike. However, both goblins and dwarves view Dwarblin as a disgusting, mutt-race, filthy and tainted by the other race.

Green skin, beards, strong, and a bit shorter and more sinewy than a typical dwarf. Fantastic tradesmen, good eye for valuables, and capable craftsmen. 

Dwarblin merchants peddling wares at the sea, while dwarblins in the mountains mine the earth. Not very magical, but good with their hands.
