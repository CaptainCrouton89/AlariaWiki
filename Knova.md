Home to the [Iron Academy](Iron Academy)—the greatest combat school in the world. Knova is composed of quite a few small islands, each of them rich with metals. 

The capital is a towering iron fortress, completely impenetrable to attack. The seas around it are guarded by a legion of triton. They gain free instruction at the academy in exchange for their services defending the islands. 

The outer fortresses are for the other, lesser schools of Knova—school of tactics/center of command for wargames is located in [Seatower](Seatower), and the school of history, strategy, and logsitics is in the north, at [Blackwater](Blackwater). Both other schools are some of the best in Alaria, though the Iron Academy is far and away the best at teachign combat.
