The [Maw of Chao](Maw of Chao) is a volcanic island surrounded by a hundred mile fog of memory loss. This fog protects the island, which is the hatching ground for thousands of [dragons](Dragons).

The island is guarded over, by [Damasaki Edara](Damasaki Edara), the daughter of [Nagatayora](Nagatayora), a massive female dragon who raises the eggs before setting them free. The dragon riders of [Adrus](Adrus) (now [Adron](Adron)) would travel to the [Maw of Chao](Maw of Chao) to be blessed by Damasaki Edara, and thereby be approved to raise and ride with [dragons](Dragons).
