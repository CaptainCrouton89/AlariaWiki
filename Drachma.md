# Overview

Drachma have black eyes and a second eyelid, similar to fish, allowing them to see perfectly clearly underwater. 

Drachma are fierce, passionate, and boisterous, and place a high emphasis on valor, panache, and following ones instincts. They are usually the first one you notice when walking into a roomâ€”both for their striking, long, shiny black hair that many of them maintain, as well as their sociable personalities. It is hard to feel unwelcome when around Drachma.

Drachma are generally found in western regions of Alaria, along the coasts, and are known for their pirates, merchants, and swindlers, as well as their hearty Drachman ale.
