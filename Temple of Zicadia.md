Temple dedicated to elemental protection magicâ€”turning air into solid structure that you can deflect attacks with. Run by [Master Felwana](Master Felwana), a reclusive woman who lost her husband in a war across the world. Came here to learn, became a master. Temple is brutal and miserable, and deals with frequent threats from the snowplains.
