The First Brotherhood is the name given to the first dwarves, and the coalition they formed. At a time when the world was far more dangerous, even dwarves who left the clan to form their own settlement had to remain part of the brotherhood—sworn to the preservation of dwarves and the dwarven way.

Now, the First Brotherood is more nominal than anything else. It's like the dwarven world union—in support of dwarves everywhere, but requiring membership fees, and sometimes not with everone's best interests in mind. And, citizens of the three city states of [Üod](Üod), [Blvnird](Blvnird), and [Melaia](Melaia) are the only ones allowed to be leaders of the union.
