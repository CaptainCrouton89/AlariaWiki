The First Brotherhood is the name given to the first [dwarves](Dwarves), and the coalition they formed. At a time when the world was far more dangerous, even dwarves who left the clan to form their own settlement had to remain part of the brotherhood—sworn to the preservation of dwarves and the [dwarven](Dwarves) way.

Now, the First Brotherood is more nominal than anything else. It's like the dwarven world union—in support of [dwarves](Dwarves) everywhere, but requiring membership fees, and sometimes not with everone's best interests in mind. And, citizens of the three city [states](States) of [Üod](Üod), [Blvnird](Blvnird), and [Melaia](Melaia) are the only ones allowed to be leaders of the union.
