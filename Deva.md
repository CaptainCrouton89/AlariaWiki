Deva are rare, beautiful, creatures with very commanding presences that enter the world fully grown, intelligent, with no family, and a single, driving purpose. Several explanation exist on how they appear, though the most supported reasoning is that they are manifestations of collective thought and hope from the Psyic plane.

Deva generally have light, gray, blueish, lavender, or red skin, and lack any pupils in their eyes, which are pure white. They are on average, slightly taller than [humans](Humans), though only slightly. Deva rarely appear looking younger than in their twenties, and rarely older than their fifties, although it does occasionally happen. They are quite rare, and in combination with their striking features, they are generally at the center of attention of any room they enter. 

Deva are always “born” with a deep feeling of hope and purpose. The source of that hope and purpose is never clear, but the force with which these drive a Deva on usually results in them pursuing that goal for the rest of their lives. These purposes are usually somewhat noble, such as “freeing the [region](Regions) from tyrannical control by a cruel aristocrat” or “leading their community safely to a new land”. These purposes tend to align with the communities in which they spawn, supporting theories of their psyic origins. 

Deva also are born with a feeling of having memories that are not entirely their own. They do not know how they know so many skills, as they remember nothing of learning them. They may have faint memories of past events within their communities, or even past experiences of other deva before them, but beyond that, it feels as though their lives began when they spawned.

When a deva dies, their body dissipates—there is no body left over. If they failed at their purpose, another deva may appear years later, or if they succeeded, another deva might not appear for hundreds of years.

Height: 5-6 feet

### Traits

#### Charismatic
*Passive ability.*

Increasing your presence die costs 2 less XP. You do not need to reach PL2 in order to take the Draconic Presence paragon level.

#### Memories Passed
*Major ability. Instant.*

The psyic energy from which you spawned occasionally provides imagery from others’ memories of the past as well, guiding you when you face difficult challenges. You may use this ability to gain advantage on any skill check you make. If the skill check also aligns with your deeper purpose, you instead gain A3. 

You also do not have a [soul](Life and Death) or [shadow](Life and Death), and are thus invisible on both the ethereal and nethereal planes. This also excludes you from effects on creatures with souls or shadows.
