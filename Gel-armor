Gel-armor is a type of armor, common to many large, underground insects. It is soft and squishy when low force is applied to it, but becomes iron-hard when sudden force is applied to it. This allows the insect to squeeze through tight spaces, but still resist violent blows from attackers.

The gel can be harvested for similar effects.
