[Kethic elementalism](Kethic Elementalism), or simply [Kethic](Kethic Elementalism), is one of the most prevalent systems of [magic](Magic). Its basis is in one of attunements. By understanding a fundamental element completely, and having a primal bond with that thing, one can develop power to control that element. As that bond and understanding grows, one’s power over that element grows. 

There are nine fundamental elements: earth, air, fire, water, light, dark, force, time, and void. With these elements, nearly everything is created. Many things are compounds of these elements, while others, such as living things, have additional, non-elemental components. 

By attuning to different elements, you have some basic power over those elements. There are three different levels of attunement for each basic element, and one level for each secondary element—each of which grant you various abilities.

However, attuning to an element is difficult. Most people never attune to any elements in their life times, and your spirit must be able to handle the additional pressure of resonating with the your attuned element. Those who do will frequently do so by accident after an unusual or extreme exposure to one of these such elements. More advanced attunements require even more exposure, and paragon level attunements generally require special activity dedicated to developing an attunement to that element.

[Kethic](Kethic Elementalism) also comes with limitations. Every living thing has some very low level attunement with all the elements, and for this reason, it is nearly impossible for another creature to interfere with elements especially close to another living being, such as its blood or flesh.
