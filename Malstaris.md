Malstaric Rivers go through the land, which can sweep your [shadow](Life and Death) away.

Huge caverns, gray wastes, and milling crowds of shadows dominate [Malstaris](Malstaris). There is no weather or seasons, and existence is void of nearly all emotion, as it seems that all passion and care is sucked out of everything and into the empty expanse. You do not hunger, nor thirst in [Malstaris](Malstaris), and sleep never seems to come. Each day drags into the next, as the sun never seems to set, but never seems to have risen either.

[Malstaris](Malstaris) is the counterpart to the Nethereal Plane, and is where shadows go upon being released from the physical body of a living creature in the Material Realm. It is ruled over by Demegolas, the Lord of the Dead, where the shadows are looked after in his huge, sprawling palace.

Long periods of time spent in [Malstaris](Malstaris) can cause strange interactions, as your [soul](Life and Death) is so far away, and your [shadow](Life and Death) so close (on the other side).

Strange creatures have made [Malstaris](Malstaris) their home, including Devourers, Mind Fiends, and Voids. 

High above [Malstaris](Malstaris) is [Nydus, the Black Sun](Nydus, the Black Sun), spilling heavy darkness across the land.
