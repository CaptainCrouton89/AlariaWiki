Forest-dwelling gnomes in [Nykotheryx Amberylika](Nykotheryx Amberylika). While the [Luma](Luma) take care of the trees, the gnomes attend to the fauna of the [forest](Forests). They live in dens built under the cover of the larger pine trees. They believe the dragon totems are sacred but dangerous. Only special "priests" among the Shyoka Saseidi are permitted near the totems. These priests are the caretakers for the fauna in those areas.
