The [Kyth](Kyth) are spectral ghost-like creatures that inhabit the [Nirvanis Mountains](Nirvanis Mountains). They have large, ghostly claws that tear at your [soul](Life and Death). They are believed to be the escaped, failed, initial experiments of the the lich [Feriptus](Feriptus) in the south.

The [Kyth](Kyth) have some intelligence, but no empathy. They can communicate vague images telepathically, and use this to terrify and confuse their prey. For example, they may create the image of a collapsing mountian in the path of the only escape, hopefully deterring their prey from escaping along the best route.

The [Kyth](Kyth) are unkillable without silvered weapons.
