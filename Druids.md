The [Druids](Druids) are the forefathers of [elves](Elves), and are also known as "greater elves". They do not die of natural causes, though they can still be killed from extreme injury. They are far more powerful, have pointier, longer ears. They were alive, and survived through the time of titans. They were alive before gaea, and still survive today (though in vastly fewer numbers).

Everything about them is grace. Merely looking at one causes shivers to go down one's spine. They are the epitome of beauty, wisdom, and grace. Looking into a druid's eyes results in being charmed.
