The [Druids](Druids) are the forefathers of [elves](Elves). They live much longer (nearly eternally), though are dying out. They are far more powerful, have pointier, longer ears. They were alive, and survived through the time of titans. They were alive before gaea, and still survive today (though in vastly fewer numbers).
