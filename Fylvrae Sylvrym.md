[Fylvrae Sylvrym](Fylvrae Sylvrym) is home to the largest group of Ulvsjael anywhere in the world. Nearly a dozen nomadic packs roam the forest, hunting and squabbling amongst themselves. Most time is spent in wolf form, though in times of extreme circumstance, councils are held in [human](Humans) form.

Rumors are that some of the packs have interbred with werewolves to expand their reach and power over the forest. 

Beneath the forest lie hundreds of skystones, buried under a foot of tree roots and undergrowth. Super valuable, but venturing into the forest is dangerous.
