## Overview

[Goblins](Goblins) grow up in large broods, all born of a single father. The size of these broods vary from group to group, but they can range from 10 to nearly 1000. Goblins will usually grow up with many of their siblings, working with them to achieve the goals of the colony. 

## Physical Appearance

Goblins are roughly the height of [gnomes](Gnomes), but usually slightly stronger. Many have a greenish tint to their skin, but goblins like [Ruddings](Ruddings) and [Red Devils](Red Devils) have redder skin, and Blitzlings have blueish skin.
