# Overview

[Goblins](Goblins) grow up in large broods, all born of a single father. The size of these broods vary from group to group, but they can range from 10 to nearly 1000. [Goblins](Goblins) will usually grow up with many of their siblings, working with them to achieve the goals of the colony. 

[Goblins](Goblins) are born in broods, from a single father and up to hundreds of mothers. A single brood-father may sire thousands of [goblin](Goblins) children, who are all raised together, with no knowledge of their specific mother. The brood-father, over the course of his lifetime, will eventually choose exactly one queen, who will mother the next brood-father—the first born son.

Most [goblins](Goblins) live in communities around a single [goblin](Goblins) lineage. Therefore, all of their neighbors and friends are one’s half-siblings. This can lead to bickering, but very rarely outright violent conflict. Living among siblings contributes to a camaraderie that many [goblins](Goblins) feel towards their brood-mates.

[Goblins](Goblins) are roughly the height of [gnomes](Gnomes), but usually slightly stronger. Many have a greenish tint to their skin, but [goblins](Goblins) like [Ruddings](Ruddings) and [Red Devils](Red Devils) have redder skin, and Blitzlings have blueish skin.

#### Cooperative
*Passive ability.*

Whenever you help someone on a skill check, or take the help action in combat, you provide two levels of [advantage](Advantage and Disadvantage) rather than one, and they may add half of any single relevant aspect you have. You do not need to spend DP. If that creature is a [goblin](Goblins), they gain three levels of [advantage](Advantage and Disadvantage) instead.
