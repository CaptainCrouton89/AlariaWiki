Krell live in enormous colonies worshipping a single queen. Once every few centuries, the queen will lay a series of eggs that will hatch to become princesses. These princesses are trained and brought up in court for 50 years before battling to the death. The final survivor chooses from a large selection of suitors, and then takes him and a retinue of soldiers and travels some distance away from the colony. This migration is called a swarming. Upon arrival, the new queen mates with the suitor, and then kills him. In the new location, they exterminate all competition in the area and beginning a new colony, and the queen proceeds to lay more eggs until the colony is up to size once more. 

While a single krell is nothing to be scared of, when the hive swarms, nothing can stand in their way. Entire settlements have been known to disappear after a new hive settles nearby. Hives eventually die when the queen passes away, opening the region for settlement by others once again. However, there is no knowing when the hive will return. 

Perhaps even more terrifying is when two hive bloodlines go to war. Casualties range in the thousands, and the clouds of vultures and crows in the will leave the skies dark for days after. 

Krell culture is complex and nuanced, founded on a system of pheromones, antennae movements, and footsteps that outsiders bare little chance of understanding. While they have vocal chords, they are short, and raspy, and they prefer not to use them.
