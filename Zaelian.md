Even among the already graceful [elves](Elves), the Zaelian stand out. Slender, tall, and starkly beautiful, the Zaelian are renown for their enchanting appearance, and disarming character. 

Through powerful magic performed eons ago, the Zaelian found a way to channel the light from the moon into their bodies, allowing them to perform some Deoric magic without the cost of their own life. Although their capacity is limited, it allows them to perform even more magic. 

This close association with Deoric magic is a significant cause of distrust for most other [races](Races), and itâ€™s not entirely unfounded. While most Zaelian are benevolent and empathetic, sects have been known to more fully embrace the Deoric spell casting lifestyle, and use the lives of prisoners and slaves in addition to moonlight to cast their spells.

The most influential Zaelian figures are known for giving up everything to succeed. In addition to that, most Zaelian have some sort of familial tradition dictating the rituals around gathering moonlight for oaths.
Zaelian can be found across Alaria, and are infamous for the number of liches that have arisen from their communities.
