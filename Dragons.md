[Dragons](Dragons) are enormously powerful, anomolous creatures, with mysterious motivations and indefinite lifetimes. There are many different types of [dragons](Dragons), as they have been around for over 100 million years.

Although [dragons](Dragons) are not immortal, they will never die of natural causes, and will frequently age to be thousands, or sometimes millions of years old. For this reason, [dragons](Dragons) have incomparable patience, and will pursue sometimes strange and nonsensical goals purely in the [spirit](Life and Death) of "because why not". This also leads many [dragons](Dragons) down a path of vicious cruelty, where the only way left to amuse oneself is the torture and suffering of others.

# History
