## History

The Ta Linn live on the prairie, a grassy steppe with occasional hills and rivers. They arrived from the West, and speak Ashakri, as do many of the other Western states. The Ta Linn once aggressively expanded, but have since run into other civilizations and have paused due to heavy aggression from their neighbors.
