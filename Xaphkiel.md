# Overview

Beautiful, angelic creatures from the plane of darkness. Midnight dark wings, pure black eyes, dark-gray skin, very symmetrical faces. Like dark angels. Absolutely hate the [Sarakiel](Sarakiel), however, and will stop at nothing to destroy them, regardless of who else gets hurt along the way. Single minded determination, absolute certainty that they are the superior [race](Races) of the entire world. 

They don't interact much with the rest of the world, because they spend most of their time fighting the Xaphkiel among the [stars](Stars). They generally reside on high-density sky-stones known as [mosodori](Mosodori) high in the sky.
