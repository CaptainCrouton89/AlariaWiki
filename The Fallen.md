The Fallen is an order comprised of a single champion. The order was established in ancient times by a mercenary hero who collected magic items and stowed them away in a hidden tower. Towards the end of the champion's life, they acquired a dark orb that would seek out a new Fallen upon the previous fallen's death. Thy new fallen would be given dreams and nightmares of their destiny by the orb. These visions led them to the hidden tower were they were gifted the entirety of the order's acrewed wealth and power. In exchange they were expected to further the order's name and influence. Often the Fallen can be seen riding an immortal nightmare which became fond of the champions over the years and allowed itself to be tamed by them.
