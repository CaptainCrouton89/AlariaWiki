The plains are completely overrun with satyrs. Random camps are everywhere, dotted with buffalo hide tents. The plains are quite fertile, but the [satyr](Satyr) can't organize well enough to begin farming.

Despite having no government, rumors of a self-proclaimed king of the satyr have begun to spread. A satyr of dark and mysterious origins, with ambitions to unite all of the Satyr. These rumors terrify [Balduahr](Balduahr), the much smaller [dwarven](Dwarves) kingdom in the southwest, which would have no hopes of defending itself if all of the satyr accross Wycenduala united.
