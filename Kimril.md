Goat legged, crazy earthling creatures. They spend all day dancing and making music. Live in boulder fields. Have strongest earth attunement of any race. They are also *willing* to teach, though not frequent occurenc, since they are so shy. Naturally super distrustful. If they think they're gonna die, they instead permanently turn to stone. Like a beestingâ€”it dies, but for good of community.
