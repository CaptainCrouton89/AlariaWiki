Tags: ruin

Large, darkstone palace, vines growing up over all of it. Overrun when a demon-summoning wizard lost control over his subjects. The demons are confined to the tower, but they're quite powerful, and immortal. Decorated with large, leathery-winged gargoyles with curling horns perched on guard. 

Sailors are incredibly superstitious of the island, won't go near it. Others make fun of them for it "the stone gargoyles just look scary, they aren't real" (they aren't, but the demons within are!)
