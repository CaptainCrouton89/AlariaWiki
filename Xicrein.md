Agents of water and darkness. Make up the [Bynü Island Tribes](Bynü Island Tribes). Those closest to the leyline of darkness exhibit more darkness traits, while the rest are mostly water. Not super interested in trade or involvement, though their sea-tech is quite advanced.

Black hair, dark features, cheekbones, brooding looks. Live in close-knit clans which consistently brutally, silent murder each other—but with honor. You don't poison, or use deoric—you slit their throat with your oyester shell blade. Everyone is skilled at killing, it seems.
