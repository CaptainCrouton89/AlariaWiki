The [Nirvanis Mountains](Nirvanis Mountains) were once home to an ancient civilization of people who died out hundreds of years ago to overhunting. All the remains are the massive stone statues dotted throughout the land, under which the dead were buried. These statues were believed to protect the mountains from evil spirits.

The mountains, do, in fact have evil spirits haunting them, which the statues protect against. These spirits are known as [Kyth](Kyth), and appear as white, spectral [ghosts](Ghosts). They come out at night and will kill those who are not spiritually warded (such as by the statues).
