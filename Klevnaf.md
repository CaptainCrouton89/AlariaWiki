Recently split from Istora due to the murder of the elven king. Some people blame the king's younger brother. 

Old King passes away. Kingdom (Istora and Klevnaf combined) goes to eldest son, Istor XXVI. Istor is murdered. Istor's daughter Lamenrae claims foul play from Istor's brother, Taoinor, and denies him the throne. It's time for a queen (Istor XXVI only had a daughter so far).
