Recently split from Istora due to the murder of the [elven](Elves) king. Some people blame the king's younger brother. 

Old King passes away. Kingdom ([Istora](Istora) and Klevnaf combined) goes to eldest son, [Istor XXVI](Istor XXVI). Istor is murdered. Istor's daughter [Lamenrae](Lamenrae) claims foul play from Istor's brother, [Taoinor](Taoinor), and denies him the throne. It's time for a queen (Istor XXVI only had a daughter so far).
