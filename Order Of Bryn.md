The Order of Bryn is an potent religious group, with collosal numbers. Have sects around the world, praying to [Bryn](Bryn). Slow migration of where summer is hotter depending on the sects. During winters, they stop praying as much (still a ton), but allow people to leave the churches and travel and learn. It gives plants a natural cycle, etc, and means that followers can have a break.

The order is always looking for new members. Some people consider it an honor, others want nothing to do with it. Within the group, you have free food and shelter for life. You are free to (and encouraged) to sleep with others and propogate the church. When you join, you are given the Mark of Bryn—a sun, branded into your chest. 

The church is always trying to get money from governments, trying to stay alive. Countries/locations can pay to have the church pray more for that area, meaning the sun lingers in the sky longer in that region, though for the most part, the sun goes aroudn the center. The Order will also use winter as a tactic to raise money—if they need more money, they can just let the winter get worse by ordering followers not to pray.

Higher level priests stare into the sun and blind themselves, further devoting themselves to Bryn's magic.
