Very old, neutral [daemon](Daemons) of darkness. Believes that dark is the necessary counterpart to a world obsessed with light. Feels at home in darkness. Is mentally ill, and thinks darkness is somehow "pure" and valuable. Hears his own voices in his head, which become the voices in the dark night.
