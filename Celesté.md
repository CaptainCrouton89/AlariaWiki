Celesté is the home of [daemons](Daemons). It is a perfect reflection of the world but lacking any of the life that exists in the material realm. Spirits arrive here upon death, and then quickly fade away as they are forgotten. Some, however, remain remembered. Those who do, should they know [Deoric](Deoric), are capable of affecting the material realm, and in return, may be worshipped as gods. These beings are called [daemons](Daemons). 

Since the world is physically unchangeable, the [daemons](Daemons) who seek opulent palaces must encourage their followers to build them in the material realm so their reflections can be enjoyed within Celesté.

While in Celesté, you have no body—only a [spirit](Life and Death)—and cannot die by any material but Ezz forged weapons, which sever your will from your [spirit](Life and Death). Instead, survival depends on the prayers of those who knew your true name and pray to you. Upon death, your [spirit](Life and Death) sinks down into Celesté, where it lasts until your true name is forgotten.

Willingly going to Celesté requires leaving your [shadow](Life and Death) and [soul](Life and Death) behind. Unless they are somehow preserved on the material plane, they will never rebind to your [spirit](Life and Death), making it impossible to ever return to the material realm.

[Deoric](Deoric) does not work on Celesté due to Ezzic interference, though many of its users reside there, using their knowledge to serve their followers back on the material plane.
