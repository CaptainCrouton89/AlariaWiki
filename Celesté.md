The core of Celesté was created long before the entire plane was made. A pocket dimension was solidified as a safe haven from Nydus and Aurus, the titan gods. It is a plane that the titan Celesté created by sacrificing herself (titans normally can't die). This created a new dimension of her own. She swore that as long as the titans remembered her sacrifice, they would survive. And thus they did, because she granted them power from her plane. None of the titans could ever enter the plane unless they died, which no one else was willing to do. However she still protected them.

After the Ezz Rift, Ezz accumulated around Celesté, as it was the only location that resonated with Melera's song.

[Celesté](Celesté) is the home of [daemons](Daemons). It is a reflection of the world but lacking any of the typical life that exists in the material realm. Spirits arrive here upon death, and then quickly fade away as they are forgotten. Some, however, remain remembered. Those who do, should they know [Deoric](Deoric), are capable of affecting the material realm, and in return, may be worshipped as gods. These beings are called [daemons](Daemons). 

Since the world is physically unchangeable, the [daemons](Daemons) who seek opulent palaces must encourage their followers to build them in the material realm so their reflections can be enjoyed within [Celesté](Celesté).

While in [Celesté](Celesté), you have no body—only a [spirit](Life and Death)—and cannot die by any material but Ezz forged weapons, which sever your will from your [spirit](Life and Death). Instead, survival depends on the prayers of those who knew your [true name](True Name) and pray to you. Upon death, your [spirit](Life and Death) sinks down into Celesté, where it lasts until your [true name](True Name) is forgotten.

Willingly going to Celesté requires leaving your [shadow](Life and Death) and [soul](Life and Death) behind. Unless they are somehow preserved on the [material plane](Material Plane), they will never rebind to your [spirit](Life and Death), making it impossible to ever return to the material realm.

[Deoric](Deoric) does not work on Celesté due to Ezzic interference, though many of its users reside there, using their knowledge to serve their followers back on the [material plane](Material Plane). 

Celesté is made of the the thoughts and beliefs of those who are alive. The world is shaped by the livings' understanding of it. You can faintly alter your own existence depending on your followers, though you are largely stuck at the whims of the living followers of the Material Plane.
