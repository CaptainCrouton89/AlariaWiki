Nothing can rot in this [forest](Forests), the trees cannot die, and the entire [forest](Forests) is just one, large organism. The forest is so dense with undergrowth that no light reaches the bottom. 

The entire understory is fungal. [Myushli](Myushli) live in small villages.

Because nothing rots, horrible forest fires come through and burn everything down, replenishing the forest with nutrients.

Sleeping on the forest floor in any season but winter will cause the roots to envelope you in your sleep.

The leaves all fall in autumn, revealing the sky above. 

Forest is north of the [Piktiniti Desert](Piktiniti Desert)
