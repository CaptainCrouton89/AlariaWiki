Nothing can rot in this [forest](Forests), the trees cannot die, and the entire [forest](Forests) is just one, large organism. The [forest](Forests) is so dense with undergrowth that no light reaches the bottom. 

The entire understory is fungal. [Myushli](Myushli) live in small villages.

Because nothing rots, horrible [forest](Forests) fires come through and burn everything down, replenishing the [forest](Forests) with nutrients.

Sleeping on the [forest](Forests) floor in any season but winter will cause the roots to envelope you in your sleep.

The leaves all fall in autumn, revealing the sky above. 

[Forest](Forests) is north of the [Piktiniti Desert](Piktiniti Desert)
