[Deoric](Deoric) is the language of absolute power. Statements spoken in [deoric](Deoric) have the power to rip the world apart, if anybody had the knowledge and capacity to wield the power required to do so. According to legends, this is the language the gods spoke when they created the world. Nowadays, the spoken language is nearly dead, though the written form remains alive in the runes used in handmagic, as well as forbidden rituals performed by the few left who know them. 

## Hand[magic](Magic)

The amount of power required to channel [Deoric](Deoric) is immense, let alone wield it in a purposeful way. It is only through the strengthening of the astral thread binding one’s [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death) that one can hope to bind the power necessary to use [Deoric](Deoric). With stronger astral thread, one’s hand can be tattooed with more runes in titan blood (or the ground up dust from titan bones, mixed into a paste) which act both as a means of holding the [magic](Magic) as well as channeling it in way described by the [Deoric](Deoric) runes. However, inscribing too many runes on one’s hand runs the risk of snapping one’s astral thread, killing the owner instantly. 

Handmagic comes in two main flavors—unique abilities, and skill buffs. Both strain your astral thread, though the skill buffs are generally simpler and cheaper, as the addition in skill is usually a less complicated rune. 

For players of Heart Rush, strengthening one’s astral thread takes the form of gaining XP and spending it on handmagic. 

## Ritual [Magic](Magic)

Ritual [magic](Magic) is [magic](Magic) performed using [Deoric](Deoric) speech, powered by blood sacrifice. Anything is possible with ritual [magic](Magic) so long as you know the words and have a suitable amount of life sacrificed. Rules for ritual [magic](Magic) are described in below the Spells section.

## Recording [Deoric](Deoric) Text

[Deoric](Deoric) cannot be recorded except with titan blood or special ink made from their ground up bones. It is magically draining to write, due to the powerful nature of the text. Writing a rune or simple command takes about an hour to complete, and causes you to lose 10 hitpoints. You regain hitpoints lost in this way at a rate of 1 hitpoint each week. 

Once [Deoric](Deoric) text is read by someone other than the author, the text disintegrates into ash. For this reason, along with the reasons above, any book of [Deoric](Deoric) text is incredibly valuable. 

## [Deoric](Deoric), [Daemons](Daemons), & [Celesté](Celesté)

[Deoric](Deoric) is primarily used by the [daemons](Daemons) of Celesté. Having been around for centuries, millennia, or in some rare cases, eons, these beings are frequently at much higher levels of mastery with the Deoric language that mortals can only dream of. By using this [magic](Magic), they serve their followers.

There are several different varieties of [magic](Magic) in [Alaria](Alaria). Each come from different sources of energy and have different properties. …**
