Weblin, also known as plains-goblin, are short, tan, potbellied, and a strange mixture of kind and emotionless. They will just as happily sell their grandma as they would an old shoe, but they are incredibly respectful of everyone they talk to. To them, everything is always as it should be. It is nearly impossible to excite or upset a weblin.
