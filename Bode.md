# Overview

Shoulder-height, huge gaping maws, and gray, sagging skin on fleshy bodies, these creatures are terrifying. Wreak of death and despair. Cause increasing levels of frightened as you get close to them (CN 14 to overcome). They feed on spirits as they leave people's bodies. Like vultures, will congregate on battle fields. Travel in herds, naturally drawn to death.
