Many warfaring [giants](Giants) live here. Massive skeletons litter the ground from their destroyed bodies. One of the more powerful giant lords recently died, resulting in a large power vacuum.

Ruins of a [halfling](Halflings) civilization present. Nothing of the city, known as [Tem Shyanna](Tem Shyanna) remains, but the fortress walls do. Trapped within are a small enclave of [halfling](Halflings) explorers, taking care of an old, senile, fire attuned [halfling](Halflings), who keeps them warm during the winter and provides the warmth for their food. The man is too senile to move, and trying to force him out makes him go berserk. 

The walls protect the [halflings](Halflings) from the [giants](Giants), but not the [wyverns](Wyverns). Either way, they are trapped here. Have been living here for 5 years now.
