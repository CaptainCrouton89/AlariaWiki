Home to the [Jotuns](Jotuns)—smaller, frosty giants. They survive and regenerate in the cold (attunement), but love the taste of flesh. Highly valued. Jotun will horde frozen [humans](Humans) as proof of their wealth. Will show them off to each other. Very cunning, though terrible communicators—similar to trolls.
