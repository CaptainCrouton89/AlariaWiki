The Gruynmar travel in collosal iron ships on the sea. Entire clans permanently reside in a single ship. These ships will park outside a new harbor every few months, trade for the duration, and then move on.

The ships are the true juggernauts of the sea. Battle against one is certain suicide. The Gruynmar have pioneered exploration into cannons, and are the only ones who know the secrets of guns. It is a well kept secret.

Gruynar themselves are bronze-skinned, with soft, curly brown or blonde hair. Those who choose to ditch their clans (not many doâ€”why would they?) make for great pirates or adventurers.

Ability ideas:

Can use guns.
