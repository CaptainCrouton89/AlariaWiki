#### Servant of Anubis
*Passive ability*

When you encounter undead creatures and can do something about it to make sure they die permanently, it makes you incredibly uncomfortable unless you do something about it. Unless it would likeley result in death or be impossible, you gain a level of vulnerability for a week unless you try to kill the undead creature. At any time, you may reject your ancestral father. If you do, you become a Foresaken of Anubis.
