# Overview

Drasnian [dwarves](Dwarves) are the eldest and by far most populous of the [dwarven](Dwarves) heritages, dating back to before the Uline dwarves went underground. Drasnians are generally a stout, serious bunch, with softer features than their other dwarven cousins, and live almost exclusively above ground or in homes built into hillsides. They have a long history of both prosperity and destitution, and through economic trade, fleeing war and persecution, and enslavement, have made it all over Alaria. Drasnians can be found in vast numbers at nearly any cultural hub, as well as in several countries where Drasnians have settled down in large numbers, including Drasnia itself, the believed birthplace of the Drasnians. 

As a whole, they value education, money, and preserving their cultural and religious legacy. Drasnian culture is rich with customs dictating worship, relationships, and oneâ€™s day-to-day life.
