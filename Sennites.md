Viewed as extremely untrustworthy. Common adage among the dwarves is to trust them to stab you in the back. In reality, the Sennos are less untrustworthy, and more pragmatic and willing to put life and livelihood over honor. Won't lie/steal unless it's to survive. 

Slimy skin, green, webbed fingers and toes. Can't breath above water any more (leader sacrificed half population with no warning to give the other half the ability to breath underwater). Lots of Deoric casters, though it's limited since new information is hard to come by. Will trade handsomely for it.
