Once lived above ground, but moved underground after [Ural of the Third Moon](Ural of the Third Moon) arrived and brought the darkness with him. Many of the [elves](Elves) are darkness and void attuned—protection mechanisms from the dangers of the surface. 

Long, black quills come from the face and body, and spines down back. The quills are midnight black—reflect no light whatsoever.
