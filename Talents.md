#### The Spider
*Passive ability. Influence.*

You have a network of spies and informants at your fingertips. Once per day while within a city within the range of your influence, you may meet with your informants to learn what is going on around town. You may ask two unique questions of the GM. If you meet with them again after a day or more, your spies return with answers. The GM answers one of your questions truthfully, and either gives false information about the other, or else doesn’t answer it at all. Any information that fewer than 25 people know about cannot be answered by your spy network.

<div class="destiny-level">Destiny Level</div class="destiny-level">

You may ask up to three questions, and may ask questions with answers that are known by no fewer than five people. The GM must truthfully answer two of the three questions.

#### Witch Brewing
*Major ability. Cognitive talent.*

By mashing up bark, roots, some berries, and other ingredients from the wilderness, you can create pastes and potions with variable effects. Brewed items go bad after one day, at which point they have no effect. Brewing a potion requires a fire and 10 uninterrupted minutes of preparation. When you forage, you may forgo a day’s worth of rations gathered to instead gather ingredients for your potions.

When you brew, choose one
- Misty Sights: This paste will incites a visions when chewed up and eaten. Upon consumption, choose one subject. You then have a series of three visions, one from the past, one from the present, and one of the future. One of those vision will be of your chosen subject. Those visions may be vague or ambiguous. 
- Ghost Brew: If you consume this potion, you take three levels of dazed and can see onto the ethereal plane for the rest of the day. The levels of dazed end when the day ends. Consuming this once every day for seven consecutive days transports you to the ethereal plane. 
- Crow’s Breakfast: When poured out into a bowl, any crows in the area will come to drink over the course of the next hour. Crows that drink gain the ability to speak common until midnight or noon, whichever is soonest.

<div class="destiny-level">Destiny Level</div class="destiny-level">

You may brew the additional, following potions:

- Death’s Cradle: After being drunk this potion will cause convulsions after 36 hours, followed by death 12 hours after, so long as Swamp’s Tears is not consumed within that time. This potion tastes of earthy mushrooms.
- Swamp’s Tears: This potion cures Death’s Cradle when ingested. It is flavorless.
- Potion of Charms: If a creature consumes this potion, they gain two levels of charmed towards you. The charm effect lasts one hour, and ends early if you attack them. This potion tastes like citrus.

#### Worldly Traveler
*Occasional ability. Slow. With GM approval.*

You have traveled the world and met many, many people. When you meet someone who the GM describes as someone you’ve never met, you may choose to claim some connection to them. If you do, the GM will explain how you recognize them, and the nature of your connection. This connection may be as distant as “you saw them drinking in a bar in a neighboring country”, or as close as, “this woman bears a strong resemblance to the thief you killed earlier today, and you suspect she is his sister”. It is possible there is no feasible connection between you and this person. In this case, you may either regain the use of this ability, or take three destiny points. You cannot use this ability to claim connections with people more influential than yourself.

<div class="destiny-level">Destiny Level</div class="destiny-level">

Rather than claim a connection to someone you meet, you may use this ability before actually running into someone. For example, while at a bar in a foreign country, you could claim that you knew a weapon enchanter who lived in this area. If the GM also believes this to be plausible, your connection becomes real (though their location and condition may have changed since the last time you talked with them). If the GM doesn’t believe this to be reasonable, you may choose not to use this ability.
