# Overview

Tikhaya are generous, quiet, and highly value strength and truth. Some would mistake Tikhaya for being socially inept, or boring, but the fact is that Tikhaya are simply uninterested in idle chat, and are comfortable spending time alone and in contemplation. There is a sort of strength that emanates from Tikhaya that has nothing to do with their physiologyâ€”but instead from their self-certainty and outlook on the ways world. Even Tikhaya children have a sort of natural wisdom about them that is hardly met by even adults of other cultures.

Tikhaya can be found across central and northern Alaria, as well as the Nautili Archipelago, and are known for their incredible philosophers, mathematicians, and martial warriors.
