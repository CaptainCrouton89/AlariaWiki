A creature’s life is dictated by the health and union of their [soul](Life and Death), [shadow](Life and Death), and [spirit](Life and Death). At the center of their being is their [spirit](Life and Death), which is the spark of free will and personality that defines who they are. Wrapped on either side are the [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death), the astral and malstaric counterbalances of the [spirit](Life and Death), which together give life and movement to the [spirit](Life and Death) they are bound to. While still critical to life, they do not define who the person is.

## Astral & Malstaric Thread

Binding the [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death) to the [spirit](Life and Death) is a creature’s astral and malstaric thread. If this thread is broken, the creature dies, and their newly freed [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death) float up and sink down to the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) and [Malstaris](Malstaris) respectively, while their [spirit](Life and Death) fades to Celesté.

If the thread is not broken but still damaged, it can nevertheless have serious effects on the life of that being. It can make one weaker to effects that would dominate ones [spirit](Life and Death), and having part of the thread break completely could cause your [soul](Life and Death) or [shadow](Life and Death) to leave completely, sapping one of most of their life and energy. 

If a creature is missing its [soul](Life and Death) or [shadow](Life and Death), its defenses against [Deoric](Deoric) [magic](Magic) are drastically weakened, and makes it susceptible to death, mind control, or anything else the caster desires.
