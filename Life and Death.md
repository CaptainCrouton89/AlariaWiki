A creature’s life is dictated by the health and union of their [soul](Life and Death), [shadow](Life and Death), and [spirit](Life and Death). At the center of their being is their [spirit](Life and Death), which is the spark of free will and personality that defines who they are. Wrapped on either side are the [soul](Life and Death) and [shadow](Life and Death), the astral and malstaric counterbalances of the spirit, which together give life and movement to the spirit they are bound to. While still critical to life, they do not define who the person is.

## Astral & Malstaric Thread

Binding the soul and shadow to the [spirit](Life and Death) is a creature’s astral and malstaric thread. If this thread is broken, the creature dies, and their newly freed [soul](Life and Death) and shadow float up and sink down to the Astral Plane and Malstaris respectively, while their [spirit](Life and Death) fades to Celesté.

If the thread is not broken but still damaged, it can nevertheless have serious effects on the life of that being. It can make one weaker to effects that would dominate ones spirit, and having part of the thread break completely could cause your soul or shadow to leave completely, sapping one of most of their life and energy.
