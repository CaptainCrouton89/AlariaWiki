Home to warring [centaur](Centaur) tribes. Lots of posturing, trying to assert dominance over each other. 

Tribes ruled by chieftain. Anyone can challenge them to take their position. Have to beat them in combat (mercy rules). Not much armor except among those in power (hard to make, slows you down, inaccessible). Most people wield spears, bows, and scimitar.
