An extremely well fed tree of knowledge, consumes people. Was once a person, permanently turned into a tree. However, can move slowly. Can't actually predict the future, but knows nearly everything from the past, and will give you advice for a steep price. Give up a limb for knowledge. 

"Give me your hand". You press hand against trunk. Trunk pulls you in, and you lose arm. People are nearby with saws—they will saw your limb off for you, and treat your wounds. They are servants of the tree. 

People sent here all the time to get knowledge. Tree wants powerful people though—not peasants, so visited by advisors to powerful people who get bullied into it.
