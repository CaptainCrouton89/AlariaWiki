Black-scaled, sleek, tall, and insanely deadly. Very poisonous, painful bite that debilitates prey, killing them only after a day or so of suffering, even with just a small nip. Less ferocious compared to the Ix'Tyrann, but just as deadly. Live in Nashua, and trapped in war against Tr√∏mgar and Gorath.

Larger mouths compared to ix'tyrann, for swallowing prey whole.
