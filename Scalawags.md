# Overview

Scalawag goblins are aptly named for their mischievous, sneaky, and up-to-no-good nature. They are viewed more as pests than as people by many of the intelligent beings of Alaria, and from a scientific perspective, their behaviors is somewhat similar to that of ants. However; living among Scalawag society shows a vivid, colorful culture of merriment, passion, and duty. Most Scalawag are born into enormous broods, and are expected to defend their lineage of goblins. These goblins will spend most of their lives doing just that, along with anything else they feel like doing. Besides the general wellbeing of the community, though, scalawags have few other obligations, and will sometimes devote horrifying amounts of time to the most absurd activities for fun or curiosity.

Scalawag can be found across the mountains and scattered throughout most cultural hubs, and are known for their incredible performers, parties, and oddly enough, philosophers. 

Primarily reside in Poum-Titch
