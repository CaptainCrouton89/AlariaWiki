Elven tribal lands. Wear auburn clothes, hunt the buffalo that graze the grasslands in the area. Loosely based off of American indians in the midwest. Terrifying/formidable. Much taller than normal elves, are able to see over the tall grass that grows here (Grasses are at nearly six feet). 

Facing tensions with Roule, which has been burning the plains down (in order to plant farms). The Rakiten have been withdrawing from the coast, and the Roules don't even know of the existence of the Rakitens, but Rakitens are deciding that maybe it's time to fight back, rather than just disappear and retreat. 

Culturally very against confrontation.
