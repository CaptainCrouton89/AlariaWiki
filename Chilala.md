Chilala

### Political Landscape
Chilala is a rugged and sparsely populated state, dominated by vast plains and scattered hills. Its major settlements—Gikonganze, Muholenzi, Paila, and Gaturnundo—are linked by ancient trade routes and rivers flowing into the lake. The state is governed by a loose confederation of tribal chiefs and city elders who convene at Gikonganze, the political and spiritual center.

Unlike the more centralized states to the south, Chilala values autonomy and tradition, often resisting external influence from the Dalizi Confederation’s core powers. Its leaders govern through consensus and maintain a delicate balance between competing clans and the pressures of trade demands.

### Factions and Power Players
- The Plains Council: A gathering of tribal chiefs and elders tasked with maintaining peace and coordinating defense.
- The River Sentinels: Guardians of the waterways and trade routes, skilled in navigation and riverine combat.
- The Windrunners: Nomadic horse clans known for their speed and scouting prowess, sometimes hired as messengers or scouts by neighboring states.
- The Grey Veil: A secretive faction of mystics and spies using wind magic and subtle influence to steer political outcomes.

### Economy
Chilala’s economy revolves around:
- **Horse Breeding and Trade:** The plains provide ideal conditions for raising strong warhorses and swift mounts, highly prized across Aboyuinzu.
- **Grain and Livestock:** Fertile soil along rivers supports grain cultivation and cattle herding, forming the staples of local trade.
- **Craftsmanship:** Skilled artisans produce weaponry, leather goods, and woven textiles sought after in Dalizi markets.
