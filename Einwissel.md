## Overview

Founded by the small colony of [dwarves](Dwarves) who traversed from [Celesté](Celesté) back to the [material plane](Material Plane). They are more in touch with the [daemons](Daemons), and they are capable of wielding each other's thoughts for [magic](Magic), but fragments of their true names are still known, putting them at enormous risk. For this reason, few [Einwissel](Einwissel) ever leave their colony, hidden deep within the mountains.

## Physical Appearance

The Eiwissel have blue-gray skin with silvery speckles in it. They are generally not as strong as the [Uline](Uline), though they are equally tall.

## Cultural Overview

The [Einwissel](Einwissel) are as rare as the lichen they are named after, and have a shyness to match. Little is known about their culture, though they are believed to hold on to some of the strict matriarchal traditions they had when they left the [material plane](Material Plane) millenia ago.
