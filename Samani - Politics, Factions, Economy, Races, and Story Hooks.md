Samani is a coastal state within the Dalizi Confederation, characterized by its oligarchic government, influential merchant guilds, and seafaring clans. The economy is driven by lake fisheries, pearl harvesting, and trade, with racial groups such as Blaize, humans, Gnomes, and Sylthik. Notable story hooks include mysterious disappearances, clan rivalries over mineral rights, and political manipulations by bandit factions.

### Political Structure
- Samani is a coastal state bordering the great Tonaetlet Chipe lake.
- Its capital and largest city is **Metato**, marked by a star on the map, indicating its importance as a political and economic hub.
- The government is a confederation-style oligarchy with influential merchant families and local chieftains sharing power.
- Samani balances internal clan rivalries through trade alliances centered on the lake's resources, but tensions simmer beneath the surface.

### Major Factions
- **Metato Merchant Guild:** Dominates trade policies and wields influence across Samani. They maintain private militias to protect commerce.
- **Yumge Clan:** Controls the northern lake shore and the trade route linking Samani to Boranaba and beyond, known for skilled river navigators and diplomats.
- **Kiniwe Port Authority:** Oversees fishing fleets and riverine trade, allied with sea-faring races and fishermen.
- **Independent bandit coalitions:** Local mountain tribes and exiles who disrupt trade along less protected routes — targets of harsh crackdowns.

### Races
- **Blaize:** A shy, flicker-skinned humanoid race native to Aboyuinzu and prominent in Metato’s artisan guilds, known for their subtle emotional influence and trade negotiation talents.
- **Humans:** The most numerous race, occupying most farming villages and towns throughout Samani.
- **Gnomes (especially Foxborn and standard Gnomes):** Skilled craftsmen and traders, heavily involved in Metato’s mercantile activities.
- **Sylthik (snake-headed zealots):** Present primarily in the mountainous border regions, tending to be hostile or secretive, rumored to engage in smuggling and clandestine dealings with bandits.

### Economy
- Thrives on **lake fisheries, freshwater pearl harvesting**, and **river trade**, exporting goods such as salted fish, rare herbs, and artisan crafts.
- **Agriculture** thrives in fertile valleys near the lake, producing staple grains and tubers.
- Exports **timber** and **metal ores** mined from nearby mountains to neighboring states.
- The port at **Metato** is a critical node in Dalizi’s internal trade network, linking waterways with overland caravan routes.
- Recently, **mysterious disappearances** of fishermen near the lake’s eastern shore have threatened economic stability.

### Story Hooks
- **The Missing Ships:** Several fishing vessels from Kiniwe have vanished without trace. Rumors suggest a supernatural predator or a faction of Sylthik bandits using dark magic to curse the waters. The Merchant Guild hires adventurers to investigate before trade collapses.
- **Clash of Clans:** The Yumge Clan and Metato Merchant Guild vie for exclusive rights to a newly discovered mineral vein in the nearby hills, risking open conflict unless a skilled diplomat can broker peace.
- **Bandit’s Bargain:** An influential bandit leader offers a secret alliance to smuggle rare goods in exchange for safe passage, tempting the Merchant Guild to break laws and risk backlash from the Dalizi Confederation’s enforcers.
- **Blaize Influence:** A Blaize artisan with unexpected political ambitions gains a sudden rise in Metato’s council, using subtle emotional manipulation—some see them as a visionary, others a dangerous manipulator.
