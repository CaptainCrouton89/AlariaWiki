A group of archers committed entirely to bettering their abilities in archery through "hunt" and "sport". This results in them tracking and killing powerful foes that they feel are largely unchallenged or too intimidating for others to fight as well as seeking out renouned archers that they can recruit or at least learn from. A Way Watcher on their would be considered slightly above or bellow the power of a [hero](Heroes) or experienced adventurer but in a group their competency soars to frightening heights.
