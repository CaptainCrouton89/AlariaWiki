Statues of redgold built by the [dwarves](Dwarves) who once lived here. Entire valley is horribly cursed (all the [dwarves](Dwarves) were killed by the Adron dragonriders.

If you have dragon blood in you, a horrible curse is placed upon you. Skin begins to turn to stone. Skin hardens, doesn't flex at all, movement becomes stilted. Won't kill you, but your agility die falls by 2 levels over course of next week. Permanent, unless forgiven by a stone [dwarf](Dwarves) descendent (only the [dwarf](Dwarves) bandit).
