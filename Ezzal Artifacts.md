Some materials and items of Alaria were imbued with ezz during the Ezz Rift. The materials were hoarded by the first dragons, then captured by [dwarven](Dwarves) king who had them forged into a collection of weapons named "thought swords". Fast as thought, and as deadly as one's imagination. The weapons melded with your mind. Extremely potent. They were necessary to become a true [swordmind](Swordmind).
