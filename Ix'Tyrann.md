# Overview

Lizard like humanoids. Viewed by most of society as savages. Cold, vicious, view most things as food or predator. Live in Da Trang, villages controlled by chieftains. There are few heroes among the Ix’Tyrann, for they fight too ferociously and savagely to be seen in a positive light, regardless of whose side they fought on.
