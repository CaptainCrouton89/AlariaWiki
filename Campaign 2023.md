# Ruins Exploration

Gnomes used to own these lands (were driven out by Erasnian nobles, granted to Myorna in exchange for silver. [Gnome](Gnomes) burial grounds lie here. Strange activity in the [forest](Forests) (previous adventurer discovered it, awoke the chambers), didn't make it out. The animals in the area are behaving strangely (very aggressive). 

Players don't know they're burial chambers. [Gnomish](Gnomes) words say "let this old man rest". Investigation uncovers dolmen with a hole dug straight into the ground. Just a hole in teh ground, illusioned over. Easy to fall in. On dolmen it says, "Let this poor old man rest".

It's 30 foot fall. Roll against height, take remainder as damage. DC 10 to see it in time, DC 10 to not fall. 

Wounded wolf pup, wimpering, missing leg. Can't walk properly. Snarls when you get close. If you befriend it, it will let you through.

R3: A small fire burns, and a razor sharp blae facing up lies over the brazier. One one side of blade is engraving of wolves, on other are engravings of a [gnome](Gnomes). Dried blood on blade. Wolf engravings on walls. Dead adventurer, throat ripped out by wolf teeth lies on floor.

If you sac wolf limb, wolf relief engravings on walls come to life, and attack you. If you sac yourself, nothing. Walled in by same substance as rock from before.

R4: Gnome chieftain's crypt stacked with personal belongings (illusions) on walls. if you touch it, rune glows. Runes are on the coffin. One out of three dots are filled with glowing light (Shovel (x) wolf blood (x) finger on treasure ( ) and coffin open ( ) )

At 4 checkboxes, chieftain wakes up. Summons [spirit](Life and Death) animals to fight for him. 


Chief: 
60hp d8 MAC, fights with spectral spear and fangs (can grow wolf teeth). If bitten, unlock lycanthropy kit. +10/6 on spear, +7 with fangs, but fangs give you level of frightened.
Can summon small animals if losing too easy.
