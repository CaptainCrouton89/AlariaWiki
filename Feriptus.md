[Feriptus](Feriptus) is a very powerful lich, living in his reclusive fortress [Ipt](Ipt), located in the far North, near the [Nirvanis Mountains](Nirvanis Mountains). [Feriptus](Feriptus) is trying to create a new [race](Races) of sentient beings that are more subservient. He believes that much of the strife in the world is caused by disagreement, and that it could be solved if fewer people were capable of disagreeing with. 

Although [tracers](Tracers) and [the guiltless](The Guiltless) have been made in the past with little success, he plans to make this new [race](Races) far more powerful, and only responsive to him, so there's no disagreement, and they can properly take over.
