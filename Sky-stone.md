Sky-stones are stones that have broken off from the lower crust of the Astral Plane, usually during its incredibly powerful earthquakes. 

The stones generally plummet quite a ways before the buoyency they experience in the Material Plane cuases them to float back up—usually not before smashing into the ground first though. Low density (density means the opposite here—it's the density of the "floaty" substance per weight of stone) stones float lower to the ground, while higher density ones can reach as high as the stars themselves (and are often populated by Xaphriel).
