#### Snake Headed
*Passive ability.*

With the head of a snake, you have venomous fangs, which count as a light, piercing melee weapon. Once per day, you may inject venom with your bite, inflicting two levels of poisoned.

Additionally, your snake tongue gives you a superb ability to track down your prey. If you spend five minutes within 10 feet of someone, you always know which direction they are in when they are within 10 miles of you. If you bite them, the range extends to 100 miles instead.

#### Disciple of Sythikranos
*Major ability. Quick.*

As a disciple of Sylthikranos, you are granted occasional favors by your snake goddess. When you invoke the name of your patron god, choose one. You gain the ability for the next hour.

- You gain advantage on all attack rolls with your bite. Your bite afflicts an additional level of poisoned when you inject poison. 
- Your snake scales harden and partially extend over the rest of your body. You have advantage on all defense rolls.
- You can communicate with snakes, and if any snakes are in the vicinity, a snake companion will join you within the next ten minutes. The snake cannot help in combat, but it can scout and observe at your command.
