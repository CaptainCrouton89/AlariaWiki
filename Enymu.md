Inhabited by [humans](Humans) and craven. Fairly similar to Nektuna in population, but much poorer in comparison, as it has no leylines nor strangehold on trade. However, it still has decent money from trade. Primarily a farming nation, and ruled by a very long line of honorable, albeit perhaps naive, kings. 

Could be persuaded to turn on Nektuna, but only with some difficulty.
