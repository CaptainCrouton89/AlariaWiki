Tags: islands

The most densely foggy islands in this half of the world. Home to an old [Tuktuk](Tuktuk) named [Gelnor](Gelnor) who is paragon attuned to fog and water. Lives here eternally to atone for his sins (he's a lich, immortal).

On shore are giant hermit crabs that eat the algae off the rocks.
