Seven feet high, they feed on human children. Masters of illusion manipulation. They can store souls in sacs on their backâ€”large, translucent membranes. They look like a boomalope combined with a hag.

Physically weak, but very capable of illusioning their way out of almost any situation. Sound of their magic was the popping sound of their membrane sacs.
