The [Anderegnons](Anderegnons) are a miserable, cold, windy range of mountains, on the border of the [Material Plane](Material Plane) and [Celesté](Celesté). It is also a rich source of [malstaric ash](malstaric ash), which can be found throughout the mountains. The [Bollinger Mining Company](Bollinger Mining Company) have discovered it, laid claim to it, and now mine and ship the ash south towards the sea.

They have so far managed to avoid the Atowtowa by skirting along the eastern edge of the [Senaveer Mountains](Senaveer Mountains). However, stray too far west and get eaten by the [Northern Rocs](Northern Rocs) in the mountains, and stray too far east an get captured and killed by the [Atowatowa](Atowatowa).

They are home to a large population of [northern rocs](Northern Roc), which hunt the caribou in the east. The mountains are rich with the lichen that feeds the caribou, so the [Atowatowa](Atowatowa) herders will journey there every spring.
