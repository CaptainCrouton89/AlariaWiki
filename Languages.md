# Deoric: The Language of Absolutes

[Deoric](Deoric) was once spoken by the titans who long ago inhabited [Alaria](Alaria). It is the language of absolutes—things spoken in [Deoric](Deoric) *must* occur, if there is power behind the words. Now, however, it is used by dark mages to perform powerful [magic](Magic). The language is extremely complex, and takes centuries to learn, but unlocks great power.

This power comes from spiritual sacrifice, usually by killing a sentient creature and performing a ritual.
