## Overview



## Physical Appearance

A fully grown ogre stands at about 7 feet, and weighs about 300 pounds. They sport small, dull tusks protruding from the bottom of their mouths, and frequently have more hairy bodies. Most are considerably stronger than humans, and although they lack some of the high level logical skills of some other races, they have superior senses, and equally profound emotions. 

## Cultural Overview

Ogres mate for life, though rarely spend time around their partnersâ€”instead spending most of their time in the tribes in which they were born into. Once a year, a couple will rejoin and may produce a single offspring.

Ogre societies are generally tribal, with a heavy emphasis placed one one's connection to nature, the gods, and your fellow tribal brothers and sisters.
