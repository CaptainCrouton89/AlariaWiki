## Overview



## Physical Appearance

A fully grown [ogre](Ogres) stands at about 7 feet, and weighs about 300 pounds. They sport small, dull tusks protruding from the bottom of their mouths, and frequently have more hairy bodies. Most are considerably stronger than [humans](Humans), and although they lack some of the high level logical skills of some other [races](Races), they have superior senses, and equally profound emotions. 

## Cultural Overview

[Ogres](Ogres) mate for life, though rarely spend time around their partnersâ€”instead spending most of their time in the tribes in which they were born into. Once a year, a couple will rejoin and may produce a single offspring.

[Ogre](Ogres) societies are generally tribal, with a heavy emphasis placed one one's connection to nature, the gods, and your fellow tribal brothers and sisters.
