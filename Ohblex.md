The Oblex rock [gnomes](Gnomes) were born from the gems and jewels deep within the [Gemstone Peaks](Gemstone Peaks). They are of every color and disposition, like the jewels they cam from. In the mountains, the [Ohblex](Ohblex) have accumulated more gems and jewels than imaginable,  hidden in insane mazes and complex mechanical traps. The [Ohblex](Ohblex) feed off of the jewels, only requiring a few every year or so to survive. Deep in the tunnels of the [Ohblex](Ohblex) mountains, they craft the jewels into incredible jewelry and clockwork pieces. They are the sole possessors of the secret of clockmaking on Nin. Many have ventured down into the caves in seek of knowledge or jewels, but no one returns. The [gnomes](Gnomes) prefer not to trade the gems they mine by themselves, and instead only give them out after they’ve been implemented in some complex trinket. The [Ohblex](Ohblex) value secrecy, mystery, and complication. Nothing makes a [Ohblex](Ohblex) [gnome](Gnomes) more excited than a difficult problem full of intrigue and mystery. Within their society, the [Ohblex](Ohblex) are endlessly scheming and vying for power amongst themselves. Huge family houses with ancient lineages compete with each other through intrigue and power maneuvering in an endless attempt to win the favor of the royal family.
