### Traits

#### Tinkerer
*Passive ability.*

Through tinkering and contraption building, you have found a way to improve on your bodyâ€™s natural features. Choose one of the following modifications from the list below.

- Spectacles. By switching out lenses on these glasses, you can see much more than otherwise. The first lens grants you infrared vision, out to 90 feet. The second  inverts light, making the dark into light and the light into dark. Dimly lit spaces remain dim. The third is a telescopic lens that lets you see as though you were 10 times closer.
- Rocket Boots. Powered by aether, these boots propel the user much faster than they would otherwise be able to move. When you dash, you may instead jump up to 10 feet in the air. While in the air, you gain a glide speed of 50 feet, and glide 5 feet for every 5 feet you fall. Your normal move speed increases by 10.
- Multi-tool. Through a complex operation, you have replaced one of your arms with a multi-tool. The tool contains a small circular saw, knives, pliers, wrenches of all sizes, a small torch, and lock picks. You have advantage on skill checks to use such tools, and you may add, modify, and adjust these tools as you see fit.

Additionally, you may spend 4 XP to gain an additional item from the above list. You have advantage on developing any new tinkers for your body.
