## Overview

[Revenants](Revenants) are those who were once alive, but whose spirits were so strong that their astral and malstaric thread remained bound, and although their bodies became inanimate, they lived on in the material world. This is generally due to having some feeling of unfinished work to do in the world, whether it be defending some person or location, completing a mission, or being with oneâ€™s true love. 
Although their bodies are gone, they maintain a semi material form, which can still interact with the world.
