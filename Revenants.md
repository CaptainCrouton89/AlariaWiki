## Overview

[Revenants](Revenants) are those who were once alive, but whose spirits were so strong that their astral and malstaric thread remained bound, and although their bodies became inanimate, they lived on in the material world. This is generally due to having some feeling of unfinished work to do in the world, whether it be defending some person or location, completing a mission, or being with one’s true love. 

Although their bodies are gone, their [spirit](Life and Death) remains intact, and they can ihabit new bodies to control them instead. 

Once you were dead, but now—well, you still are, kind of. Revenants are semi corporeal versions of their past, living, selves. When a creature dies and rather than leaving its physical form, chooses to remain within, it forfeits its ability to ever leave and is eternally trapped in the material world where they remain as a revenant. There are many reasons revenants may choose to stay, but the most common involve unfinished business. Whether it’s getting revenge, or fighting for a cause they believe in, this goal is a top priority. While revenants may take detours along the way, they will always come back to their purpose for remaining in the material world.

By remaining in the material world, revenants forfeit their rights to an afterlife. Once a revenant has completed whatever business kept them in this world, they generally slowly go crazy and are eventually hunted down and killed by children of Anubis or other specialized killers. 
Due to revenant’s near immortality, they are forced to watch as everyone they love inevitably grows old and dies, which contributes to the slow decaying of their sanity.

### Traits

#### Undead
*Passive ability.*

You no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe, and cannot be poisoned.

You have already died, and can therefore not die again in the traditional sense. However, should your maximum hitpoints fall to 0 and you “die”, you fall unconscious for 24 hours and are reborn where you died the first time with no memory of your life after death. 

You take double damage from silvered weapons, and if you should die to a silver weapon, you are dead forever.

Also, your physical body is no longer fully alive, and it will slowly decay with passing time. Though you can generally maintain your appearance from your moment of death, your skin will no longer close up over wounds, so your body will begin to fall apart. For this reason, many revenants prefer to cover up as much of their skin as possible, and to travel unnoticed. Once you have died in a corpse three times, it is too mangled to ever return to.

#### Detached Spirit
*Passive ability.*

You have a soul, shadow, and spirit—all necessary for true life, but they are no longer bound to your corporal body in the same way—instead, it is through willpower alone that you keep them attached to your physical form. This is a constant struggle, and when you waver, your form flickers as your spirit sloughs away from your skin. This, however, comes with benefits. 

As an action, you may let your concentration fall, causing you to dissolve into a pool of light and shadow. While in this form, you gain the following effects:

- You can fit through any space larger than the width of a pebble. 
- You cannot interact with the physical world
- You take half damage from all non-silver, non-iron sources, rounded down. 
- You can only take the help or dash action.
- You cannot speak.
- Your physical body remains collapsed wherever you left it. You may return to it, or any other unoccupied corpse.
