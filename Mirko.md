A very vertical city. Built in the space between the tide and the hills. Deep canals lead into the depths of the city. Highest murder rates of anywhere.

Home to humans, chargon, nyolci, karchon, and elves. Very active mafia, and some of biggest gambling rings in the world. Multiple high-power thief and assassin guilds have their headquarters located here. The city is conveniently located, ignores demands of its neighbors, has no laws, and contacts everywhere.
