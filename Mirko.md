A very vertical city. Built in the space between the tide and the hills. Deep canals lead into the depths of the city. Highest murder rates of anywhere.

Home to humans, chargon, nyolci, karchon, and elves. Very active mafia, and some of biggest gambling rings in the world. Multiple high-power thief and assassin guilds have their headquarters located here. The city is conveniently located, ignores demands of its neighbors, has no laws, and contacts everywhere.

Origins lie from when they offered protection to some pirates fleeing privateers. The pirate repaid them with a small fortune, granting the city the money to grow, and decided to make the place his permanent residence.
