A disgusting cross between goblins and rats, these creatures multiply tremendously fast, aren't super bright, and plague cities. They are difficult to get rid of, can wriggle in and out of anywhere. 

No one bats an eye if you kill one. They are sentient, but don't posess empathy of their own. Feed on carrion, anything. Will steal babies if left unattended.
