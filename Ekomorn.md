Rift in the Ishnit Jungles. Absurdly deep—all the way to the center of the material plane.

The [Naruaghin](Naruaghin) who live in the surrounding jungle are terrified of the pit, and won't go near it.

Occasionally, *thinsgs* emerge from the pit. Animals brutally killed and left to rot on outside edge of cliff. a mile down, and 30 miles north-east, is a location where someone has devoted their life to the study of darkness. It is within the rift, but deep, deep inside.

The rift extends at a diagonal much further than you can tell from map—jungle has just grown over it. Shadows sometimes come up from the cracks.
