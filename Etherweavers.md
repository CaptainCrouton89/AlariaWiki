# Overview

longtime mastery over the non-basic elements—light, dark, force, time, and void. The entire etherweaver bloodline is interwoven with these elements, and every [goblin](Goblins) is born with an attunement to one of those elements.

The etherweavers who leave the brood usually go on to become mystics and shamans, as their natural affinity for the more non-basic elements gives them a leg up over others, though etherweavers can be found in nearly any other profession as well—having elemental attunements can always come in handy.

Etherweaver bloodline pops up randomly in [goblin](Goblins) broods. It "overrides" typical [goblin](Goblins) features. Sometimes they are killed for being different, while other times they are held in great importance as a rarity.

Large density in [Yuki](Yuki), tho this random bloodline has popped up all over Alaria.
