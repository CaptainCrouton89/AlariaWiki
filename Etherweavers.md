# Overview

longtime mastery over the non-basic elements—light, dark, force, time, and void. The entire etherweaver bloodline is interwoven with these elements, and every [goblin](Goblins) is born with an attunement to one of those elements.
Etherweavers are generally more reserved and cautious than their Scalawag cousins. They value preparation, and are usually more conscientious, even if not knowledgable, of the world beyond the brood. Etherweavers are also usually adept at protecting their broods using magic, and therefore require fewer goblins to protect, meaning that etherweaver communities are much smaller, ranging in the 10s to 100s. The smaller numbers leads to a greater sense of individuality among the etherweavers, and means that serving the brood is less of a duty and more of a commitment to family. 
The etherweavers who leave the brood usually go on to become mystics and shamans, as their natural affinity for the more non-basic elements gives them a leg up over others, though etherweavers can be found in nearly any other profession as well—having elemental attunements can always come in handy.
