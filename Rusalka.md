*Passive ability.*

As an action, you may take on the appearance of a female humanoid. In addition, you can breath both water and air, suffer no penalties to combat in the water so long as you are not wielding a weapon, and you gain a swim speed equal to half of your move speed.

#### Flesh Eater
*Passive ability.*

You may turn your hands into deadly weapons as they go from hands to claws. Your hands count as a light, melee slashing weapon. You can never starve, but you gain a level of vulnerability if you do not eat humanoid flesh for a week or more. You cannot eat normal food.
