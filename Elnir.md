The Elnir were once druids, but have since been corrupted by Deoric and Azus. They desire to *control* nature to a degree that is terrifying. 

Will put animals in splints and casts, will splice animals together, will force trees to grow in rigid lines. Terrifying "mad-scientist" of nature vibes. View humanoids as no different than animals, and will happily experiment on them as well.

They can shapeshift at will (they control their own "nature"), and have superhuman strength, sight, smell, and so on. Usually will specialize in a specific variety of control (scorpion sting, venomous fangs, poisonous skin, talons, etc).
