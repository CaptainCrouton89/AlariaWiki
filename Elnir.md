The Elnir were once druids, but have since been corrupted by Deoric and Azus. They desire to *control* nature to a degree that is terrifying. 

Will put animals in splints and casts, will splice animals together, will force trees to grow in rigid lines. Terrifying "mad-scientist" of nature vibes. View humanoids as no different than animals, and will happily experiment on them as well.
