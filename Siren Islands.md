Tags: islands

The islands here are shear cliffs, and inhabiated by sirens who live in small caves within the cliffs. They can climb up the cliff-sides with their talons, and will sit in alcoves and sing to the sailors. Not only are the sirens dangerous (they'll eat you), but the cliffs themselves are treacherous, as huges swells come in and bash people against the rocks. 

Only reason to come here is if you want to interact with the sirens, who know gaeic melodies.
