This [desert](Deserts) was created when a massive meteor struck a [desert](Deserts) oasis kingdom. In a last ditch effort to avert the collision, powerful fire mages transfered the heat from the explosion to the rest of the desert. Although the oasis city was still destroyed, the meteor was not as cataclysmic. However, the distributed heat melted the [desert](Deserts), turning it to glass. 

Over the millenia, this glass has been sandblasted and fracturedâ€”resulting in some places being blanketed in huge swaths of glass fragments. 

[Rocs](Rocs) in the nearby mountains now hunt large prey by lifting them up into the sky, and dropping them on the desert to break their bones before bringing them back to their enormous nests in the mountains.
