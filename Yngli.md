Have spindly arms, and slightly pot bellied. Not creepy levels, but definitely weird. Incapable of speaking, which has led them to become a second-class race nearly everywhere. Can't negotiate, totally screwed. Will union under one Yngi which has picked up some telepathic abilities. However, still easy to exploit by isolating them.

# History

One of them that was helping the cylops working on a macguffin that would allow the cylops to be more powerful ran his mouth too much, causing the cylops to have his work and plans scooped. He cursed the entire race as revenge.
