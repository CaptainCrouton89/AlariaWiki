The Material Plane is enormous, and consists of several different layers. On the top half is [Belagria](Belagria), consisting of the [Surfacelands](Surfacelands) and the [Underrealms](Underrealms). The surface lands are where most of "life" occurs. Countries bicker over land and resources, empires rise and fall, and life goes on. The Underrealms, on the other hand, are a 200 mile thick crust of stone crisscrossed with tunnels and caves, and filled with mysteries and monsters.

As you travel deeper into the Underrealms, the downward pressure keeping your boots pressed to the ground grows weaker and weaker until you eventually reach [Emphathum](Emphathum)—a 100 mile stretch of weightlessness, filled with floating stones and absolute darkness.

If you down even further, your weight returns, but in the opposite direction from before. Now, you would be heading up, and would be in the second, lower half of the Material Plane—[Phlethageros](Phlethageros). Phlethageros is dominated by a [Zylogmus Eternus](Zylogmus Eternus), a massive maze, which eventually ends at the lower surface known as [the Wastes](The Wastes)—the Phlethagoran counterpart to the Surfacelands.

### [Belagria](Belagria)

The top part of the material plane, consisting of the Surface and the Underrealms. Typical fantasy world right here.

#### [The Surface](The Surface)

Countries bicker over land and resources, empires rise and fall, and life goes on. "Normal".

#### [The Underrealms](The Underrealms)

200 miles of earth below the surface. Filled with all manners of creatures and beasts.

### Ethereal/Nethereal Planes

The ethereal plane is where you [soul](Life and Death) resides during your life. Some people are capable of seeing onto it, using learned or innate soul-sight. The plane is a misty, translucent husk of the material realm, where solids are nearly invisible, and other souls are brightly visible. 

### Celesté

Celesté is the home of [daemons](Daemons). It is a perfect reflection of the world but lacking any of the life that exists in the material realm. Spirits arrive here upon death, and then quickly fade away as they are forgotten. Some, however, remain remembered. Those who do, should they know [Deoric](Deoric), are capable of affecting the material realm, and in return, may be worshipped as gods. These beings are called [daemons](Daemons). 

Since the world is physically unchangeable, the [daemons](Daemons) who seek opulent palaces must encourage their followers to build them in the material realm so their reflections can be enjoyed within Celesté.

While in Celesté, you have no body—only a [spirit](Life and Death)—and cannot die by any material but Ezz forged weapons, which sever your will from your [spirit](Life and Death). Instead, survival depends on the prayers of those who knew your [true name](True Name) and pray to you. Upon death, your [spirit](Life and Death) sinks down into Celesté, where it lasts until your [true name](True Name) is forgotten.

Willingly going to Celesté requires leaving your [shadow](Life and Death) and [soul](Life and Death) behind. Unless they are somehow preserved on the material plane, they will never rebind to your [spirit](Life and Death), making it impossible to ever return to the material realm.

[Deoric](Deoric) does not work on Celesté due to Ezzic interference, though many of its users reside there, using their knowledge to serve their followers back on the material plane. 

### [Emphathum](Emphathum)

A region with zero gravity, massive floating rocks similar to asteroids, and almost no life. Few have ever crossed this. It is the space between the Underrealms and Zylogmus Eternus.

### [Phlethageros](Phlethageros)

The world on the underside of Belagria. Cruel, corrupted, and horrible, it is a brutal world.

#### [Zylogmus Eternus](Zylogmus Eternus)

Millions of miles of labrythine passages stretching across the entire plane, for the entire 200 miles beneath the Wastes and Emphathum.

#### [The Wastes](The Wastes)

The barren, lava covered, poison-gas filled, tornado ridden surface of Phethageros. Nothing gets past this—a barrier between the demons above, and the prisoners of Zylogmus Eternus below. 

#### [Stalactites of Geth](Stalactites of Geth)

Massive, low hanging stalactites constantly pour forth lava from above the Wastes. Hundreds of thousands of demons live in these stalactites.

### The Edges of the World

**North/South/East/West**: if you walk far enough in any of the cardinal direction, eventually you will wrap around the side of the world and into Celesté.

**Up**: Although it is difficult, by traveling directly up far enough, you eventually reach the Astral Sea, and then the Astral Plane itself. 

**Down**: Reaching Malstaris by foot is by all practical means—impossible. Instead, those who wish to journey there travel via [Deoric](Deoric) [magic](Magic).
