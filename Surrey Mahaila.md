The Dwelyn queen's beautiful, emerald dragon. In [Enapay](Enapay). Absolutely ancient dragon, connected with the Dwelyn for as long as the Dwelyn have existed. The dragon is now sick, however. The song of Melera has been poisoned nearby.

Dragon of darkness, water, and earth. Serpentine, slippery, beautiful. Great powers over sleep, mind, and a ferocious melee fighter.
