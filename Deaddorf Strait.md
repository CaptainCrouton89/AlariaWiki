The name of the strait comes from a misspelling of a description of the strait: dead-dwarves. This strait sees the most [dwarven](Dwarves) deaths while in transport to [Kyagos](Kyagos), and their bodies are thrown overboard. On occasion, the bodies can be thick enough to cause mile long stretches of open sea to smell of rotten flesh.
