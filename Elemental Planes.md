All of the primary elements of the world each make up a layer, thinly placed in between the material [planes](Planes) (astral, malstaric, material realm) and the immaterial [planes](Planes) (ethereal, nethereal, Celestian). Things and creatures with higher attunement to these other layers cause the layers to spill down and into the visible world, affecting the material [planes](Planes). The layers closer to the material [planes](Planes) are more accessible to those on the material [planes](Planes), whereas the elemental layers closer to Celest√© and the other immaterial [planes](Planes) are more accessible to those inhabitants instead.

[Leylines](Leylines) are cracks in the planes where individual elemental [planes](Planes) spill through much closer to the material plane. Thes are areas of much stronger elemental power. Elemental [magic](Magic) performed on leylines is always more fantastic.

Those layers are:

- [Yolus](Yolus) (Fire)
- [Sulus](Sulus) (Air)
- [Golus](Golus) (Earth)
- [Pelus](Pelus) (Water)
- [Vulus](Vulus) (Darkness)
- [Kunus](Kunus) (Light)
- [Nilus](Nilus) (Void)
- [Izzus](Izzus) (Time)

Along certain lines across the land, these elemental planes bend much closer to the Material Plane. Those lines on which they bend closer are known as Leylines, and are locations where elemental magic relying on the corresponding element will be much more potent.
