## Overview

While Danaki may be a fast hire for a mercenary crew, Lorean are more likely to be found as the commanding general for a king’s army. In describing the difference between Lorean and Danaki, it is most famously quoted that “Lorean think with their head, not with their horns”. Of course, if you ask their spouses, they will say that they “think with their head, not with their hearts”. This is the cursed blessing of Lorean—incredibly tactically minded, but seemingly incapable of thinking about problems in any other way.

Lorean culture places a heavy emphasis on education and sound decision making. To make a mistake because emotions clouded one’s judgement is worthy of profound shame. It’s not that Lorean don't experience emotions—they do—but to let them influence one’s decision at all is weakness and failure, especially when other people’s wellbeing is at stake.

This sense of duty towards protection lies as deeply, if not more so, as their aversion towards emotional decision-making. A Lorean who has been placed in charge of his troop will die before letting his troop get hurt. To fail in this would be the ultimate failure as a [minotaur](Minotaur)—worthy of self-exile. Although Lorean would never hold anyone else to such high standards, including other minotaur, every  Lorean would never give such leniency to themselves.
