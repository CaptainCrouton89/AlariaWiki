All around [Melrox Island](Melrox Island), the [Xibli Islands](Xibli Islands), and [Alkron Tidal Islands](Alkron Tidal Islands), the Xibli have made their home. The Xibli are a race of aquatic creatures, very similar to goblins. Many believe that they descended from goblins.

Blue skin, webbed hands and feet, spiny backs, double-lidded eyes, and with sharp, needle teeth. They spend most of their time in the water, but they come on shore into intertidal areas to sleep, reproduce, and sometimes celebrate. Wirey, slippery, and believe in unrestricted freedom. They will invite outsiders to celebrate with them, but would never truly accept them into their society.
