Sun passes around center strip every day, all year. No Tilt. 

Three moons pass over at various times throughout month.

It is always summer in some places, or winter in others.

Stars are viewports for the gods. They can look down upon their subjects. Usually located above some place of importance to them.

Moon cycles: Two main moons, one has 11 day cycles, is used to tell what day of the week it is. Full moon once a week, on the start of the week. The other goes through a 23 day cycle, meaning about once every year there is one double full moon, and one moonless night, each important holidays. The year is 200 days long, split into eight, 25 day quarters, beginning on the northern summer solstice (no summer v winter with two hemispheres). 2 quarters spring, 2 quarters summer, 2 quarters fall, 2 quarters winter. When solstice (new year) coincides with a double full moon, or a double empty, it signals the beginning of a new age, occurring once every 25,300 years (~18,000 Earth Years). Smaller ages occur every 11, 23, and 253 years. 

Third, rogue moon, known as the Killing Moon. Looking upon it kills you. Comes up once every 8,000 years or so, but isn't consistent. Remains up for same duration, so can mean ~8,000 years of death. 

Years counted forward from 0 to 25,300, and then back down again. The suffix F or B stands for if time is going forward or backward. At 0 there is a double new moon during the northern-summer solstice/southern-winter solstice. At 25,300, there is a double full moon on new-year. Each marks the beginning of a new age. 

Moons aligning represents cycle of [magic](Magic), whereas new year is cycle of nature. Moon [elf](Elves), and other cultures who center life around the arcane generally worship and celebrate lunar holidaysâ€”every 253 days on dual full moon, etc. 

Seasons are more celebrated by commonfolk, less attached to [magic](Magic) and more so to nature. Celebrations on first day of spring, new-year/solstice, last week of fall, and other solstice. Both are celebrated, though winter ones are more about trying to be cheerful in the face of winter.

Moon and [Magic](Magic) divinely intertwined.
