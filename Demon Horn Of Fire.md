The demon horn of fire is a magic item. It was created by the god of demons after a cunning demon fire mage enslaved hundereds of humans (and a few other races) and sacrificed them in a volcano. Among the sacrificed were peasants and soldiers alike as well a few nobles and heroes. The souls of the sacrificed were consumed by the god of demons who then used it to create the horn of fire and gift it to the demon mage as thanks for their sevitude and worship. After watching the demon mage use the horn, the god of demons decided that it actually wanted the horn for themselves and slayed the mage in order to reclaim the horn before the mage left the valcano. The horn is considered a legendary item that can be used primarily by bards or fire mages. Playing the horn casts powerful fire spells depending on the tune or melody. Most spells favor area damage and raw power over more technical attributes but skilled musicians can force the horn to produce more elloquent spells as well. The horn responds to the music played on it but it can also convert mana of a fire user into music which allows non-bards to use the horn so long as they can channel fire-attuned mana through it.
