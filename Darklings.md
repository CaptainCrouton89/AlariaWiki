Live in [Lethos](http://localhost:5501/Lethos)

pitch black, dark skinned [goblins](Goblins). Magical attunement with darkness. Super creepy, live in villages, eat rodents + bats. They will fuck you up in the dark. Their darkness attunement is stronger, and can’t be seen through except by them, and can’t be overpowered except by magical light. The [druids](Druids) also live here, pocketed away in hermit cottages. [Druids](Druids) are the forefathers of the [elves](Elves)—longer ears, dying out, paler, much stronger nature [magic](Magic).
