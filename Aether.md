Aether is the primary meta-fluid source of energy on [Lanthornia](Lanthornia)—a nearby planar stack. An eruption on lanthornia caused a sizable quantity of aether and lanthornium to be expelled from the planar stack and land in Alaria.

Some creatures of Alaria have some sensitivity to the material and can manipulate it and pull it out of the air. Aether is used to power sky ships and a number of other machines and contraptions.

Raw Aether spends most of it's time in the air—inert, invisible, and immaterial. However, it can be extracted and processed with a little water, turning it into a powerful fuel. On contact with a purified lanthornium vibrating at a specific frequency, the aether will begin to expand, losing it's bond with the water and becoming non-substantive once more. Aether engines frequently involve lanthornium plates being struck to start, causing an self-striking process to continue feeding more aether and lanthornium strikes.

An uncommon, gray-blue type of stone that requires some expensive processing to purify.
