Cruel, woodling creatures. Love to torture travelers. Can turn into treesâ€”are indistinguishable from normal trees. Insanely strong, decently intelligent. Don't need anything to survive, feel superior, enjoy torturing visitors.

Live in [Ichneum](Ichneum), [Tenekee Woods](Tenekee Woods), [Goranyakak](Goranyakak), so on...
