I have no master!
Ammut’s Justice
Major ability.
You begin to feed a still living person’s [soul](Life and Death) to Ammut. You may spend an action to cause a creature that you are touching to lose one level of its heart die. The creature must be either asleep, tied up, or in some other way completely incapacitated. Simply being restrained is not enough.
