A massive stone object, permanently trapping the [Sennites](Sennites) within [Ennros Lake](Ennros Lake). Named after [Mythras](Mythras), the great [dwarven](Dwarves) family and king of Argysis before it fell to the dragon. When they got revenge, they placed a powerful enchantment on lake, barring the Sennites from ever leaving the lake. The Sennites would pay very handsomely for its removal.

On it is engraved, "A promise, once broken, can be no better reforged than a sword of diamond". 

If a sword of diamond is brought to the site and broken, the enchantment is lifted. 

[Diamonds](Diamonds) necessary to make an entire sword can only be found deep underground (verrrry deep) where it would be quite sketchy to go.
