# Overview

If there is one thing that can be said abut Goshwen gnomes, it is that they are clever. Not intelligent, nor wise—few are scholars, and they get into trouble all the time—but they are definitely clever. Inventors, tricksters, comedians, thieves, merchants—these are the professions Goshwen are known for. Goshwen are a good natured, frequently witty people, who have lived on Alaria for eons. While countries go to war, the Goswhen are content to lace their cities with illusions and abstain from battle. There are no Goshwen empires, nor Goshwen wars, or invasions. Goshwen are elusive, and competent.

Goshwen’s culture of openness and constant change has resulted in numerous fragmentations of their communities. This has given rise to many different branches of Goshwen communities across Alaria with different quirks and identities. However, all of them maintain their appreciation for progress and wit.
