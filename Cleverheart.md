# Cleverheart

Cleverhearts are best at providing help to their teammates—either augmenting their attacks, or debuffing enemies to make their attacks weaker. 

Two types of cleverhearts exist—scoundrels and tacticians.

###### Above the Fray

*Passive ability. Exemplar.*

Although not necessarily the best at dishing out the damage in a fight, supports excel at everything else. Once per turn, you may make an object interaction, skill check, disengage action, or help action for free.

###### Tactics

*Minor ability. Instant. Exemplar.*

You can spot out the weak points in your enemies’ defenses and direct your allies towards them. Choose a creature within 30 feet.

For each additional condition met, attacks against that creature are made with an additional level of advantage until the end of the round. 

- Creature has a wall on two sides
- Creature is adjacent to two or more allies
- Creature is prone
- Creature has three or more levels of a single condition
- Creature is affected by three or more different conditions
