The massive, undead empire of the south. Definitely worrisome for everyone in the [region](Regions). Led by [Xynoth Azkonor](Xynoth Azkonor), undead lich king.

The undead mill aimlessly when not directed by Xynoth or his henchmen. 95% of population are undead (no spirit), but 5% are still pretty evil, but have free will. Have surivived by pillaging and enslaving. Live slaves tend to fields to provide for few remaining living people. Undead keep watch. Relentless army.

Boxed in by sea and mountains, and armies have dwindled. Needs an influx of shadows/souls to resume campaign and cross the mountains or the sea.

Can't get through the smoky mountains cuz the Firesworn are too  well burrowed in. Can't get through mountains cuz treacherous and decently defended. Will cross sea once they can build boats, though they have no way of building boats yet.

The undead are unruly and vicious, barely kept in check by [Xynoth Azkonor](Xynoth Azkonor). Cities are in [state](States) of disrepair because everyone is incompetent and selfish. Only know how to steal, not create.

### No Roads

Nearly all travel takes place on the rivers. Ground is very softâ€”terrible for roads.

## The War

Armies continue to march south from the capital. People are fleeing, seeking refuge in the [Gray Citadel](Gray Citadel) and [Methrayn](Methrayn).
