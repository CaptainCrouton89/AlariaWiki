# [Alaria](Alaria)

In the very middle is the Material Plane—a world of kingdoms and conquest and magic, dominated by typical masses of land and ocean. However, on the opposite side of the Material Plane—as though on the flip side—lies [Celesté](Celesté): the realm of daemons. It is a dream-like mirror image of the material plane. 

"Above" the [Material Plane](Material Plane) is the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane). Although technically connected to the Material Plane, it is quite distant from it, and the laws of physics and nature are different. The Astral Plane is home to ghosts, and consists of small desert islands scattered throughout a vast ocean under a bright white sun. On the flip side of the Astral Plane is [Astraeva](Astraeva), where...

"Below" the Material Plane is [Malstaris](Malstaris)—an intensely dark, mountainous, ashen land filled with caves and covered with black lakes. Like the Astral Plane, it is physically connected to the Material Plane, but has different laws of nature, and is fundamentally inhospitable to creatures that live on the Material Plane. On its flip side is [Vindumor](Vindumor), where...

In addition to these planes, there are nine planes of the primary elements, known as the [elemental planes](Elemental Planes), each thinly overlayed on the top sides of the three main layers. 

Lastly, there are two very faint planes that overlay all of the rest of the planes—the [Ethereal](Ethereal Plane) and [Nethereal](Nethereal Plane) Planes. Physical objects do not exist in these planes, but elements of ones spirit, among other types of energy, can be found on these planes.

Each layer is also connected at their borders. Traveling to the far West or East of any plane takes you to its flip side, while traveling to the far North or South takes you to the next or previous layer, or off the edge of the world if you are traveling North on the upper layer, or South on the lower layer. 

## Psyic Energy

Psyic energy makes up the space between the planar layers of [Alaria](Alaria). It is an ever-present, omnipresent, swirling mass of the thoughts of all life within the [planar stack](Planar Stack). Through special practice or natural ability, this energy can be harnessed to perform [magic](Magic) on [Alaria](Alaria).
