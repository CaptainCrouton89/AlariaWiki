Tags: [planes](Planes), [planar stack](Planar Stack)

The Alarian [Planar Stack](Planar Stack), also commonly known as [Alaria](Alaria), is the focus of this almanac/wiki. Within it lie three layers, each consisting of a top side and bottom side: in the middle—the Material Realm and Celesté; above—the Ethereal Plane and Astral Plane; and below—the Nethereal Plane and Malstaris. The flip side of each plane is its counterpart.

Each layer is also connected at their borders. Traveling to the far West or East of any plane takes you to its flip side, while traveling to the far North or South takes you to the next or previous layer, or off the edge of the world if you are traveling North on the upper layer, or South on the lower layer. 

## Psyic Energy

Psyic energy makes up the space between the planar layers of [Alaria](Alaria). It is an ever-present, omnipresent, swirling mass of the thoughts of all life within the [planar stack](Planar Stack). Through special practice or natural ability, this energy can be harnessed to perform magic on [Alaria](Alaria). 

## Central Layer

Most of the drama of Alaria occurs in the [planes](Planes) of the central layer—the material realm and Celesté.

### Material Realm

The material realm is where most of “life” occurs. Countries bicker over land and resources, empires rise and fall, and life goes on.

### Celesté

Celesté is the home of daemons. It is a perfect reflection of the world but lacking any of the life that exists in the material realm. Spirits arrive here upon death, and then quickly fade away as they are forgotten. Some, however, remain remembered. Those who do, should they know Deoric, are capable of affecting the material realm, and in return, may be worshipped as gods. These beings are called daemons. 

Since the world is physically unchangeable, the daemons who seek opulent palaces must encourage their followers to build them in the material realm so their reflections can be enjoyed within Celesté.

While in Celesté, you have no body—only a spirit—and cannot die by any material but Ezz forged weapons, which sever your will from your spirit. Instead, survival depends on the prayers of those who knew your true name and pray to you. Upon death, your spirit sinks down into Celesté, where it lasts until your true name is forgotten.

Willingly going to Celesté requires leaving your shadow and soul behind. Unless they are somehow preserved on the material plane, they will never rebind to your spirit, making it impossible to ever return to the material realm.

Deoric does not work on Celesté due to Ezzic interference, though many of its users reside there, using their knowledge to serve their followers back on the material plane. 

## Top Layer

### Ethereal Plane

The ethereal plane is where you soul resides during your life. Some people are capable of seeing onto it, using learned or innate soul-sight. The plane is a misty, translucent husk of the material realm, where solids are nearly invisible, and other souls are brightly visible. 

### Astral Plane

All souls of the living go to the Astral Plane upon death. The Astral Plane is composed of a vast sea, dotted with millions of islands, populated with thousands and thousands of the the souls of the dead. *** is the self declared queen of the souls, though dozens of other powerful figures of the Astral Plane vie for his position.
The mountainous underbelly of the ethereal plane can sometimes be seen from the material realm below. The entire underbelly is covered in colossal mountains which undergo [mountain](Mountains) shaking earthquakes every millennia or so. The rocks that break free and plummet to the material realm during these earthquakes provide the astral stones used for intercontinental travel, due to their strange buoyancy in air. 

## Bottom Layer

### The Nethereal Plane

The nethereal plane is where you shadow resides during your life. Some people are capable of seeing into it, using learned or innate shadow-sigh. The plane is a dark, shadowing husk of the material realm, where solids are nearly invisible, and other shadows are dark as night.

### Malstaris

Huge caverns, gray wastes, and milling crowds of shadows dominate Malstaris. There is no weather or seasons, and existence is void of nearly all emotion, as it seems that all passion and care is sucked out of everything and into the empty expanse. You do not hunger, nor thirst in Malstaris, and sleep never seems to come. Each day drags into the next, as the sun never seems to set, but never seems to have risen either.

Malstaris is the counterpart to the Nethereal Plane, and is where shadows go upon being released from the physical body of a living creature in the Material Realm. It is ruled over by Demegolas, the Lord of the Dead, where the shadows are looked after in his huge, sprawling palace.

Long periods of time spent in Malstaris can cause strange interactions, as your soul is so far away, and your shadow so close (on the other side).

Strange creatures have made Malstaris their home, including Devourers, Mind Fiends, and Voids. 

## Elemental Layers

All of the primary elements of the world each make up a layer, thinly placed in between the material planes (astral, malstaric, material realm) and the immaterial planes (ethereal, nethereal, Celestian). Things and creatures with higher attunement to these other layers cause the layers to spill down and into the visible world, affecting the material planes. The layers closer to the material planes are more accessible to those on the material planes, whereas the elemental layers closer to Celesté and the other immaterial planes are more accessible to those inhabitants instead.
