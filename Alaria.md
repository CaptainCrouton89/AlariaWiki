Tags: [planes](Planes), [planar stack](Planar Stack)

The Alarian [Planar Stack](Planar Stack), also commonly known as [Alaria](Alaria), is the focus of this almanac. Within it lie several planes, stacked on top of each other. 

In the very middle is the Material Plane—a world of kingdoms and conquest and magic, dominated by typical masses of land and ocean. However, on the opposite side of the Material Plane—as though on the flip side—lies Celesté: the realm of daemons. It is a dream-like mirror image of the material plane. 

"Above" the [Material Plane](Material Plane) is the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane). Although technically connected to the Material Plane, it is quite distant from it, and the laws of physics and nature are different. The Astral Plane is home to ghosts, and consists of small desert islands scattered throughout a vast ocean under a bright white sun. On the flip side of the Astral Plane is [Astraeva](Astraeva), where...

"Below" the Material Plane is [Malstaris](Malstaris)—an intensely dark, mountainous, ashen land filled with caves and covered with black lakes. Like the Astral Plane, it is physically connected to the Material Plane, but has different laws of nature, and is fundamentally inhospitable to creatures that live on the Material Plane. On its flip side is [Vindumor](Vindumor), where...

In addition to these planes, there are nine planes of the primary elements, known as the [elemental planes](elemental planes), each thinly overlayed on the top sides of the three main layers. 

Lastly, there are two very faint planes that overlay all of the rest of the planes—the [Ethereal](Ethereal Plane) and [Nethereal](Nethereal Plane) Planes. Physical objects do not exist in these planes, but elements of ones spirit, among other types of energy, can be found on these planes. 

# Geography of the Planes



# Elemental Planes

Those layers are:

- [Yolus](Yolus) (Fire)
- [Sulus](Sulus) (Air)
- [Golus](Golus) (Earth)
- [Pelus](Pelus) (Water)
- [Vulus](Vulus) (Darkness)
- [Kunus](Kunus) (Light)
- [Nilus](Nilus) (Void)
- [Izzus](Izzus) (Time)

Along certain lines across the land, these elemental planes bend much closer to the Material Plane. Those lines on which they bend closer are known as Leylines, and are locations where elemental magic relying on the corresponding element will be much more potent.

## [Maps](Maps)

Each layer is also connected at their borders. Traveling to the far West or East of any plane takes you to its flip side, while traveling to the far North or South takes you to the next or previous layer, or off the edge of the world if you are traveling North on the upper layer, or South on the lower layer. 

## Psyic Energy

Psyic energy makes up the space between the planar layers of [Alaria](Alaria). It is an ever-present, omnipresent, swirling mass of the thoughts of all life within the [planar stack](Planar Stack). Through special practice or natural ability, this energy can be harnessed to perform [magic](Magic) on [Alaria](Alaria). 

# Central Layer

 Travel there is theorized to be possible, but all who try never return.


### [Astral Plane](Astral Plane)

All souls of the living go to the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) upon death. The [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) is composed of a vast sea, dotted with millions of islands, populated with thousands and thousands of the the souls of the dead. *** is the self declared queen of the souls, though dozens of other powerful figures of the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) vie for his position.

The mountainous underbelly of the ethereal plane can sometimes be seen from the material realm below. The entire underbelly is covered in colossal mountains which undergo [mountain](Mountains) shaking earthquakes every millennia or so. The rocks that break free and plummet to the material realm during these earthquakes provide the astral stones used for intercontinental travel, due to their strange buoyancy in the Astral Sea. 



## Celesté

Celesté is the home of [daemons](Daemons). It is a perfect reflection of the world but lacking any of the life that exists in the material realm. Spirits arrive here upon death, and then quickly fade away as they are forgotten. Some, however, remain remembered. Those who do, should they know [Deoric](Deoric), are capable of affecting the material realm, and in return, may be worshipped as gods. These beings are called [daemons](Daemons). 

Since the world is physically unchangeable, the [daemons](Daemons) who seek opulent palaces must encourage their followers to build them in the material realm so their reflections can be enjoyed within Celesté.

While in Celesté, you have no body—only a [spirit](Life and Death)—and cannot die by any material but Ezz forged weapons, which sever your will from your [spirit](Life and Death). Instead, survival depends on the prayers of those who knew your true name and pray to you. Upon death, your [spirit](Life and Death) sinks down into Celesté, where it lasts until your true name is forgotten.

Willingly going to Celesté requires leaving your [shadow](Life and Death) and [soul](Life and Death) behind. Unless they are somehow preserved on the material plane, they will never rebind to your [spirit](Life and Death), making it impossible to ever return to the material realm.

[Deoric](Deoric) does not work on Celesté due to Ezzic interference, though many of its users reside there, using their knowledge to serve their followers back on the material plane. 

# [Astral Plane](Astral Plane)

All souls of the living go to the Astral Plane upon death. The Astral Plane is composed of a vast sea, dotted with millions of islands, populated with thousands and thousands of the the souls of the dead. Alisandre the Beautiful is the self declared queen of the souls, though dozens of other powerful figures of the Astral Plane vie for power.

The mountainous underbelly of the ethereal plane can sometimes be seen from the material realm below. The entire underbelly is covered in colossal mountains which undergo [mountain](Mountains) shaking earthquakes every millennia or so. The rocks that break free and plummet to the material realm during these earthquakes provide the astral stones used for intercontinental travel, due to their strange buoyancy in air. 

High above the Astral Sea is [Azus, the White Sun]. 

# [Malstaris](Malstaris)

Huge caverns, gray wastes, and milling crowds of shadows dominate [Malstaris](Malstaris). There is no weather or seasons, and existence is void of nearly all emotion, as it seems that all passion and care is sucked out of everything and into the empty expanse. You do not hunger, nor thirst in [Malstaris](Malstaris), and sleep never seems to come. Each day drags into the next, as the sun never seems to set, but never seems to have risen either.

[Malstaris](Malstaris) is the counterpart to the Nethereal Plane, and is where shadows go upon being released from the physical body of a living creature in the Material Realm. It is ruled over by Demegolas, the Lord of the Dead, where the shadows are looked after in his huge, sprawling palace.

Long periods of time spent in [Malstaris](Malstaris) can cause strange interactions, as your [soul](Life and Death) is so far away, and your [shadow](Life and Death) so close (on the other side).

Strange creatures have made [Malstaris](Malstaris) their home, including Devourers, Mind Fiends, and Voids. 

High above Malstaris is [Nydus, the Black Sun], spilling heavy darkness across the land.

# Elemental Layers

All of the primary elements of the world each make up a layer, thinly placed in between the material [planes](Planes) (astral, malstaric, material realm) and the immaterial [planes](Planes) (ethereal, nethereal, Celestian). Things and creatures with higher attunement to these other layers cause the layers to spill down and into the visible world, affecting the material [planes](Planes). The layers closer to the material [planes](Planes) are more accessible to those on the material [planes](Planes), whereas the elemental layers closer to Celesté and the other immaterial planes are more accessible to those inhabitants instead.

[Leylines](Leylines) are cracks in the planes where individual elemental [planes](Planes) spill through much closer to the material plane. Thes are areas of much stronger elemental power. Elemental [magic](Magic) performed on leylines is always more fantastic.
