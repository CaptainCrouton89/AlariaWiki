## [Maps](Maps)

The Alarian [Planar Stack](Planar Stack), also commonly known as [Alaria](Alaria), is the focus of this almanac/wiki. Within it lie three layers, each consisting of a top side and bottom side: in the middle—the Material Realm and Celesté; above—the Ethereal Plane and [Astral Plane](Astral Plane); and below—the Nethereal Plane and [Malstaris](Malstaris). The flip side of each plane is its counterpart.

Each layer is also connected at their borders. Traveling to the far West or East of any plane takes you to its flip side, while traveling to the far North or South takes you to the next or previous layer, or off the edge of the world if you are traveling North on the upper layer, or South on the lower layer. 

## Psyic Energy

Psyic energy makes up the space between the planar layers of [Alaria](Alaria). It is an ever-present, omnipresent, swirling mass of the thoughts of all life within the [planar stack](Planar Stack). Through special practice or natural ability, this energy can be harnessed to perform [magic](Magic) on [Alaria](Alaria). 

# Central Layer

Most of the drama of [Alaria](Alaria) occurs in the [planes](Planes) of the central layer—the material realm and Celesté.

### Material Plane

The Material Plane is where most of "life" occurs. Countries bicker over land and resources, empires rise and fall, and life goes on. The Material Plane has an upper and lower half, each with their own surface. See [the Wastes](The Wastes), [Zylogmus Eternus](Zylogmus Eternus), [Emphathum](Emphathum), and the [Underrealms](Underrealms).

The Material Plane is lit by the Sun, a giant orb of Astral stone, made up of sunstone (heavily light attuned). It floats across the astral sea each night, then rolls over, becoming the moon, and lighting up the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) from below as it makes its jounrey across the sky in the opposite direction. It's enchanted, to continue indefinitely.

### [Belagria](Belagria)

The top part of the material plane, consisting of the Surface and the Underrealms. Typical fantasy world right here.

#### [The Surface](The Surface)

Countries bicker over land and resources, empires rise and fall, and life goes on. "Normal".

#### [The Underrealms](The Underrealms)

200 miles of earth below the surface. Filled with all manners of creatures and beasts.

### Ethereal/Nethereal Planes

The ethereal plane is where you [soul](Life and Death) resides during your life. Some people are capable of seeing onto it, using learned or innate soul-sight. The plane is a misty, translucent husk of the material realm, where solids are nearly invisible, and other souls are brightly visible. 

### Celesté

Celesté is the home of [daemons](Daemons). It is a perfect reflection of the world but lacking any of the life that exists in the material realm. Spirits arrive here upon death, and then quickly fade away as they are forgotten. Some, however, remain remembered. Those who do, should they know [Deoric](Deoric), are capable of affecting the material realm, and in return, may be worshipped as gods. These beings are called [daemons](Daemons). 

Since the world is physically unchangeable, the [daemons](Daemons) who seek opulent palaces must encourage their followers to build them in the material realm so their reflections can be enjoyed within Celesté.

While in Celesté, you have no body—only a [spirit](Life and Death)—and cannot die by any material but Ezz forged weapons, which sever your will from your [spirit](Life and Death). Instead, survival depends on the prayers of those who knew your [true name](True Name) and pray to you. Upon death, your [spirit](Life and Death) sinks down into Celesté, where it lasts until your [true name](True Name) is forgotten.

Willingly going to Celesté requires leaving your [shadow](Life and Death) and [soul](Life and Death) behind. Unless they are somehow preserved on the material plane, they will never rebind to your [spirit](Life and Death), making it impossible to ever return to the material realm.

[Deoric](Deoric) does not work on Celesté due to Ezzic interference, though many of its users reside there, using their knowledge to serve their followers back on the material plane. 

### [Emphathum](Emphathum)

A region with zero gravity, massive floating rocks similar to asteroids, and almost no life. Few have ever crossed this. It is the space between the Underrealms and Zylogmus Eternus.

### [Phlethageros](Phlethageros)

The world on the underside of Belagria. Cruel, corrupted, and horrible, it is a brutal world.

#### [Zylogmus Eternus](Zylogmus Eternus)

Millions of miles of labrythine passages stretching across the entire plane, for the entire 200 miles beneath the Wastes and Emphathum.

#### [The Wastes](The Wastes)

The barren, lava covered, poison-gas filled, tornado ridden surface of Phethageros. Nothing gets past this—a barrier between the demons above, and the prisoners of Zylogmus Eternus below. 

#### [Stalactites of Geth](Stalactites of Geth)

Massive, low hanging stalactites constantly pour forth lava from above the Wastes. Hundreds of thousands of demons live in these stalactites.

### The Edges of the World

**North/South/East/West**: if you walk far enough in any of the cardinal direction, eventually you will wrap around the side of the world and into Celesté.

**Up**: Although it is difficult, by traveling directly up far enough, you eventually reach the Astral Sea, and then the Astral Plane itself. 

**Down**: Reaching Malstaris by foot is by all practical means—impossible. Instead, those who wish to journey there travel via [Deoric](Deoric) [magic](Magic). Travel there is theorized to be possible, but all who try never return.


### [Astral Plane](Astral Plane)

All souls of the living go to the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) upon death. The [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) is composed of a vast sea, dotted with millions of islands, populated with thousands and thousands of the the souls of the dead. *** is the self declared queen of the souls, though dozens of other powerful figures of the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) vie for his position.

The mountainous underbelly of the ethereal plane can sometimes be seen from the material realm below. The entire underbelly is covered in colossal mountains which undergo [mountain](Mountains) shaking earthquakes every millennia or so. The rocks that break free and plummet to the material realm during these earthquakes provide the astral stones used for intercontinental travel, due to their strange buoyancy in the Astral Sea. 



## Celesté

Celesté is the home of [daemons](Daemons). It is a perfect reflection of the world but lacking any of the life that exists in the material realm. Spirits arrive here upon death, and then quickly fade away as they are forgotten. Some, however, remain remembered. Those who do, should they know [Deoric](Deoric), are capable of affecting the material realm, and in return, may be worshipped as gods. These beings are called [daemons](Daemons).

# [Astral Plane](Astral Plane)

All souls of the living go to the Astral Plane upon death. The Astral Plane is composed of a vast sea, dotted with millions of islands, populated with thousands and thousands of the the souls of the dead. Alisandre the Beautiful is the self declared queen of the souls, though dozens of other powerful figures of the Astral Plane vie for power.

The mountainous underbelly of the ethereal plane can sometimes be seen from the material realm below. The entire underbelly is covered in colossal mountains which undergo [mountain](Mountains) shaking earthquakes every millennia or so. The rocks that break free and plummet to the material realm during these earthquakes provide the astral stones used for intercontinental travel, due to their strange buoyancy in air. 

High above the Astral Sea is [Azus, the White Sun]. 

# [Malstaris](Malstaris)

Huge caverns, gray wastes, and milling crowds of shadows dominate [Malstaris](Malstaris). There is no weather or seasons, and existence is void of nearly all emotion, as it seems that all passion and care is sucked out of everything and into the empty expanse. You do not hunger, nor thirst in [Malstaris](Malstaris), and sleep never seems to come. Each day drags into the next, as the sun never seems to set, but never seems to have risen either.

[Malstaris](Malstaris) is the counterpart to the Nethereal Plane, and is where shadows go upon being released from the physical body of a living creature in the Material Realm. It is ruled over by Demegolas, the Lord of the Dead, where the shadows are looked after in his huge, sprawling palace.

Long periods of time spent in [Malstaris](Malstaris) can cause strange interactions, as your [soul](Life and Death) is so far away, and your [shadow](Life and Death) so close (on the other side).

Strange creatures have made [Malstaris](Malstaris) their home, including Devourers, Mind Fiends, and Voids. 

High above Malstaris is [Nydus, the Black Sun], spilling heavy darkness across the land.

# Elemental Layers

All of the primary elements of the world each make up a layer, thinly placed in between the material [planes](Planes) (astral, malstaric, material realm) and the immaterial [planes](Planes) (ethereal, nethereal, Celestian). Things and creatures with higher attunement to these other layers cause the layers to spill down and into the visible world, affecting the material [planes](Planes). The layers closer to the material [planes](Planes) are more accessible to those on the material [planes](Planes), whereas the elemental layers closer to Celesté and the other immaterial planes are more accessible to those inhabitants instead.

[Leylines](Leylines) are cracks in the planes where individual elemental [planes](Planes) spill through much closer to the material plane. Thes are areas of much stronger elemental power. Elemental [magic](Magic) performed on leylines is always more fantastic.
