Welcome! This is the Almanac of [Alaria](Alaria)—a guide to the world of [Alaria](Alaria). It aims to provide enough information to answer any of the Big Questions™ ranging all the way from "How does [magic](Magic) work?" down to "Why is this country at war with this other country?" Hopefully you find it useful for whatever your needs may be.

# About Alaria

 The Alarian [Planar Stack](Planar Stack), also commonly known as [Alaria](Alaria), is the focus of this almanac. Within it lie several [planes](Planes), stacked on top of each other. 

# [Geography](Geography) of the [Planes](Planes)

In the very middle is the [Material Plane](Material Plane)—a world of kingdoms and conquest and [magic](Magic), dominated by typical masses of land and ocean. However, on the opposite side of the [Material Plane](Material Plane)—as though on the flip side—lies [Celesté](Celesté): the realm of [daemons](Daemons). It is a dream-like mirror image of the material plane. 

"Above" the [Material Plane](Material Plane) is the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane). Although technically connected to the Material Plane, it is quite distant from it, and the laws of physics and nature are different. The [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) is home to [ghosts](Ghosts), and consists of small [desert](Deserts) islands scattered throughout a vast ocean under a bright [white sun](Aurus, the White Sun). On the flip side of the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane) is [Astraeva](Astraeva), where...

"Below" the Material Plane is [Malstaris](Malstaris)—an intensely dark, mountainous, ashen land filled with caves and covered with black lakes. Like the [Astral Plane](Astral Plane), it is physically connected to the Material Plane, but has different laws of nature, and is fundamentally inhospitable to creatures that live on the Material Plane. On its flip side is [Vindumor](Vindumor), where...

In addition to these planes, there are nine planes of the primary elements, known as the [elemental planes](Elemental Planes), each thinly overlayed on the top sides of the three main layers. 

Lastly, there are two very faint planes that overlay all of the rest of the planes—the [Ethereal](Ethereal Plane) and [Nethereal](Nethereal Plane) Planes. Physical objects do not exist in these planes, but elements of ones [spirit](Life and Death), among other types of energy, can be found on these planes. 

## Planar Travel

Many of the planes are physically connected to one another, although their connections do not always obey Euclidean laws of geometry. 

Each plane is a square, meaning that each plane has four sides where the plane ends. Crossing any one of these borders results in flipping to the "opposite" side of that plane. For exmaple, if you were on the Material Plane, upon reaching the edge of the ocean, you could continue travling that direction but now be traveling back towards land (as though mirrored) and now in [Celesté](Celesté). 

Likewise, traveling to the border north, south, west, or eastern border of [Malstaris](Malstaris) would take you to Vindumor. 

Traveling between the Material Plane and the Astral Plane or [Malstaris](Malstaris) requires vertical distance, as opposed to horizontal. The sky of the Material Plane is the furthest abysses of the Astral sea. As you travel up higher and higher, the air becomes ocean, and eventually you reach the Astral Plane. Similarly, to reach Malstaris, one must travel up through the Crags of Geth in Phlethagoras until one eventually reaches the surface again, on Malstaris.

Getting to the other [planes](Planes) is more difficult, and usually completely incompatible with one's survival. Although some people can channel power from the [elemental planes](Elemental Planes), and others can see or dream on the Ethereal or Nethereal [Planes](Planes), none can sustain [spirit](Life and Death), [soul](Life and Death), or [shadow](Life and Death).

# Psyic Energy

Psyic energy makes up the space between the planar layers of [Alaria](Alaria). It is an ever-present, omnipresent, swirling mass of the thoughts of all life within the [planar stack](Planar Stack). Through special practice or natural ability, this energy can be harnessed to perform [magic](Magic) on [Alaria](Alaria).
