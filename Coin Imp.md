A pet for many merchants in the West. It's like a parrot, but it is incredibly good at counting and arithmatic, making it the perfect companion for someone who deals with lots of coins. They love shiny objects, and spend their time toying with gems from their masters. Not super intelligent, despite their ability to do math. Sold by breeders in large cities.
