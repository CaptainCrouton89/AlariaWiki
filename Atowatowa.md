The [Atowatowa](Atowatowa) are a xenophobic group of caribou herders, residing in [Anu'Itiklik](Anu'itiklik). Many are born with natural air attunements, allowing them to soothe the airs immediately around them. The Atowatowa live nomadically, traveling wherever there is lichen for their herd. All of them ride the caribou.

In the far north, a special lichen grows in the mountains that causes the caribou to grow much larger. This lichen is given to special caribou within the herds, which are groomed to be the mounts for leaders within the group. These caribou grow up to 14 feet high.

The Atowatowa disapprove of the mining operation happening in the [Anderegnons](Anderegnons), north and west of Anu'Itiklik.
