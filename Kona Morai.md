A massive, white expanse—freezing cold, miserable, and incredibly dangerous.

Home to [Mythandrulve](Mythandrulve), similar to the [chulpe](Chulpe), but all white, and similar to wolves. No heirarchy of control like with chulpe—just a pack. All of them are roughly same size—smaller than Terragones, but bigger than chulpe. Huge paws, can run on top of the snow.

Think "vampire wolf gnolls" for vibe.
