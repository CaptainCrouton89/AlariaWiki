Huge coliseum. Owned by [Aneron](Aneron), Patrón of the city. Lots of corruption.

Also known as the City of Gold. Mpehi's Patrón, [Aneron](Aneron), is granted the touch of gold by [Bathemiel](Bathemiel), a gold dragon chained up in the north.

The city is essentially owned by Aneron, though few have ever seen him (actually a her!).
